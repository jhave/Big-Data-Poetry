					To the one who sets a second place at the table anyway.    To the one at the back of the empty bus.  To the ones who name each piece of stained glass projected on a white wall.  To anyone convinced that a monologue is a conversation with the past.  To the one who loses with the deck he marked.    To those who are destined to inherit the meek.    To us.
