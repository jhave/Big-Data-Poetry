At the Circus
****!****

At the center of the lit circle, rising 
from cotton-candy calf muscles, 
the White Clown ushers his 
eyebrows skyward. He grates his ukulele, 
opens a heart-shaped mouth, inhales-- 
his serenade begins. 

Now's the time. From the shadows, 
a blast like a trumpeting elephant: 
obscene, ragged. The Auguste capers like a fawn, 
darts away, pads around 
with his trombone. The gold of the slide 
slips into and out of the infinite. 

Everything smells of panther 
and piss and mint. His gaze fixed 
on the clash between the welled tears 
and the awful laughing shoes, 
the little boy grows 
ever more grave, ever more severe.
