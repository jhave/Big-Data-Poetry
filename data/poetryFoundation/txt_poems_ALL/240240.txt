Her Scar
****!****

Remember me: the murmuring lips half said
in half-light, buried in the hollow
a boy's neck made, as now inside his head
they stir again, though twenty years swallow 
the purest parts of her, all but her plea,
this taunt--what act from him could it command?
The boy who'd know is gone--Re-member me--
but what man can assemble limbs, make stand
again those legs that twined in his, or hitch
the yoke of hips to sway and resurrect 
a girl? I try, but only recollect
her scar--each lewd, profaning, cautered stitch--
vermiform, red, furrowed belly to breast:
where nights, long past, he'd laid his head in rest.
