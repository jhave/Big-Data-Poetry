A collector of   walks, I was practicing my llamastep 
when one of   those white geese with the knob 
of cheddar on its bill honked at the goslings 
ignoring the art of the rank and file so adored 
by Mussolini and other assorted lunatics 
who I have trouble believing could ever raise one leg 
parallel to the earth they scorched without falling 
prey to gravity that was given a special kind of dominion 
over the fascist paunch, a shabby thing 
I have never seen hang around the waist of a goose, 
though who can say for sure under all that heavenly 
down where the hips of a goose begin and end; and even 
if   tomorrow some budding scholar published a treatise 
titled The Mystery of Goose Hips to fanfare, 
it would be an exaggeration of   the grossest kind 
to equate a goose's trumpet with the barking 
from the balcony by the sad bullies whose love 
of   the locked leg I will never understand 
since the knee was so obviously made to flex, 
which means locking one is most likely a kind of sin 
against Darwin or God, both of whom I think 
would disapprove of anything so unnatural 
as even twenty people moving in stiff unison 
to music unless the brass and strings 
were just about to sway and bend to the hot 
version of  "When the Saints Go Marching In.”
