Sonnets to Morpheus ["I know kung fu"]
****!****

 "I know kung fu.” It won't bring back the world.
 5:15 a.m.: I wake from another dream,
 the same as every dream. A man builds a ship
 in my chest. Each of the sailors
 carries by her breast a picture of her sister.
 The ship is not the image of a ship.
 Beyond its sails there are no stars.
 The water is only water because it's black.
  
 5:15 a.m. Perhaps you've seen me
 practicing my moves in the empty prison yard
 and wondered whether you were the dreamer
 conjuring me into existence from the bare
 desire to caress a phantom ship
 and my death the death of your desire.
