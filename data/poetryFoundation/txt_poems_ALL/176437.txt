Virgin, sappy, gorgeous, the right-now   
Flutters its huge prosthetics at us, flung 
To the spotlights, frozen in motion, center-ice. 

And the first rows, shaken with an afterslice 
That's bowled them into their seats like a big wet ciao.   
O daffy panoply O rare device 

O flashing leg-iron at a whopping price   
Whipping us into ecstasies and how, 
The whole galumphing Garden swung and swung, 

A rescue helicopter's bottom rung   
Glinting and spinning off, a scud of fluff,   
A slash of petals up against the bough, 

A juggler's avalanche of silken stuff   
Gushing in white-hot verticals among   
Camels and axels and pyramids, oh wow, 

Bewilderment is parachute enough. 
We jolt. A sidewise stutterstep in chorus.   
The other billboards flicker by before us. 

Gone! with a budded petulance that stung.   
So talented! So targeted! So young!   
Such concentration on the bottom line! 

We vanish down the IRT. A shine. 
A glimmer. Something. Nothing. To think twice   
Was to have lost the trick of paradise.
