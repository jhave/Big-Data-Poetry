An hour is not a house
****!****

An hour is not a house,
a life is not a house,
you do not go through them as if 
they were doors to another.

Yet an hour can have shape and proportion, 
four walls, a ceiling.
An hour can be dropped like a glass.

Some want quiet as others want bread.
Some want sleep.

My eyes went 
to the window, as a cat or dog left alone does.
