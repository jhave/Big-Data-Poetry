Bravery
****!****

A rung's 
come broken in the 
ladder to the mow

and so one hesitates 
to clamber up there
just to bomb a cow
with dung or bother 
swallows from their 
rafter cakes. It takes
a new footing some-
where in the ribs' 
treads, about heart- 
height, to climb it 
now. A new gap's in
the smile that smiles
from the limed barn 
floor. There seems 
to come a break in 
the war. But soon, one
of a neighbor's sons, 
too young to know 
it was otherwise once, 
braves it, and soon, 
even with a sweater-
swaddled kitten or a 
BB gun, all the kids 
can do it again, nearly 
at a run, like pros, and
so it goes, as before.
