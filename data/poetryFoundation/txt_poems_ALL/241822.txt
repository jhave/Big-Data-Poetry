Our Conversation
****!****

Pure gaze, you are lightning beyond the last trees
and you are the last trees'
past, branching 
green lightning 
of terminal brain branches 
numened densely with summer's
hunter color, as night comes on, 
the ocean they conceal
gone berserk, wind still rising.
Pure seeing, dual vortex doors 
to the blue fire where
sex is burned away, and all 
is as it was and I am being offered
in your eyes, as in cupped hands,
the water of to never thirst again.
Again I turn away, 
and the future comes, all at once 
towering around me 
on every side, and I am lost.
Pure looking, past pain 
(this is promised):
we must have wed on poverty's most hair-raising day 
delighting, flashing risk, risk
unfailingly lighting the way, 
anything possible 
in that dissolving of seam 
between minds, 
no more golden time--
each step I took
the right step, words 
came to me finally and finding the place 
you had set for them,
once again 
wrote themselves down.
Till true word's anvil ring, and 
solid tap of winged blind cane come,
I wish you 
all the aloneness you hunger for.
That big kitchen table where you sit laughing 
with friends, I see it happening.
And I wish that I could not be 
so much with you
when I'm suddenly not; that
inwardly you might switch 
time, to sleep
and winter while you went about 
your life, until you woke up 
well,
our conversation resumed.
Ceaseless blue lightning, this 
love passing through me: 
I know somehow it will go on
reaching you, reaching you
instantly
when I'm not in the way; 
when it is no longer deflected 
by all the dark bents, all
I tried to overcome but I could not--
so much light pulled off course 
as it passed within reach, so much
lost, lost in me, 
but no more.
