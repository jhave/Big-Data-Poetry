Refusing Silence
****!****

Heartbeat trembling
 your kingdom
 of leaves
 near the ceremony
 of water, I never
 insisted on you. I admit
 I delayed. I was the Empress
 of Delay. But it can't be
 put off now. On the sacred branch
 of my only voice – I insist.
 Insist for us all,
 which is the job
 of the voice, and especially 
 of the poet. Else
 what am I for, what use
 am I if I don't
 insist?
 There are messages to send.
 Gatherings and songs.
 Because we need
 to insist. Else what are we
 for? What use
 are we?
