The Last Man
****!****

for Vivian Schatz
Here, in our familiar streets, the day   
is brisk with winter's business. 
The reassuring rows of brick façades,   
litter baskets overflowing 
with the harvest of the streets 
and, when the light turns, the people   
move in unison, the cars miraculously   
slide to a stop, no one is killed,   
the streets, for some reason, do not   
show the blood that is pouring   
like a tide, on other shores. 

         Martinez, the last peasant left alive   
         in his village, refuses to run, hopes   
         that God, El Salvador, 
         will let him get the harvest in. 
         "Can a fish live out of water?” he says   
         for why he stays, and weeds 
         another row, ignoring the fins   
         of sharks that push up 
         through the furrows. 

Here, it is said, we live 
in the belly of the beast. Ahab sits 
forever at the helm, his skin 
white wax, an effigy. The whale carries   
him, lashed to its side by the ropes 
from his own harpoon. His eyes 
are dead. His ivory leg 
juts from the flank of Leviathan 
like a useless tooth. 

         One more time, the distant sail appears,   
         a cloud forms, an old icon for mercy   
         turned up in a dusty corner 
         of the sky, preparing rain 
         for the parched land, Rachel 
         weeping for her children. "Can a fish   
         live out of water?” he asks 
         and the rain answers, in Spanish,   
         manitas de plata 
         little hands of silver on his brow.
