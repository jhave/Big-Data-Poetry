Aubade Ending with the Death of a Mosquito

--at Apollo Hospital, Dhaka
Let me break
                            free of these lace-frail 
                            lilac fingers disrobing
the black sky
                            from the windows of this 
                            room, I sit helpless, waiting,
silent--sister,
                            because you drew from me
                            the coil of red twine: loneliness--
spooled inside--
                            once, I wanted to say one 
                            true thing, as in, I want more
in this life,
                            or, the sky is hurt, a blue vessel-- 
                            we pass through each other,
like weary
                            sweepers haunting through glass 
                            doors, arcing across gray floors
faint trails
                            of dust we leave behind--he 
                            touches my hand, waits for me
to clutch back
                            while mosquitoes rise like smoke 
                            from this cold marble floor,
from altars,
                            seeking the blood still humming 
                            in our unsaved bodies--he sighs,
I make a fist,
                            I kill this one leaving raw
                            kisses raised on our bare necks--
because I woke
                            alone in the myth of one life, I will 
                            myself into another--how strange,
to witness
                            nameless, the tangled shape 
                            our blood makes across us,
my open palm.
