is thought to be a confession, won by endless 
torture, but which our interrogators must 
hate to record--all those old code names, dates, 
the standard narrative of sandpaper 
throats, even its remorse, fall ignored. Far 

away, a late (not lost) messenger stares, 
struck by window bargains or is it the gift 
of a sudden solicitude: is she going to 
lift up her shadow's weight, shift hers 
onto it? She knows who bears whom. In 

that momentary museum where memory occurs

lessened fingernails, eyes teased to a pulp, 
we beg for closeups. Ormolus, objets d'art!  
A satyr drains an hourglass with one gulp.
