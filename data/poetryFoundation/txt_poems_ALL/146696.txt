Undone Song at Neap Tide
****!****

When the sun and moon were in quadrature, when   
the garden had become a wilderness and the clock refused to strike 

When the old year died and the sand walked into 
the sea with the neap tide 

When you had been too long away and your old snowblue footprints 
clotted and hesitated in the clay

When the worry of this undone song unsung so long 
so loud my head I went inside and under to let the flood run free
