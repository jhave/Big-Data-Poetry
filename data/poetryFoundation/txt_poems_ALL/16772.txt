I grow old under an intensity 
Of questioning looks. Nonsense, 
I try to say, I cannot teach you children 
How to live.--If not you, who will? 
Cries one of them aloud, grasping my gilded 
Frame till the world sways. If not you, who will? 
Between their visits the table, its arrangement 
Of Bible, fern and Paisley, all past change, 
Does very nicely. If ever I feel curious 
As to what others endure, 
Across the parlor you provide examples, 
Wide open, sunny, of everything I am 
Not. You embrace a whole world without once caring 
To set it in order. That takes thought. Out there 
Something is being picked. The red-and-white bandannas 
Go to my heart. A fine young man 
Rides by on horseback. Now the door shuts. Hester 
Confides in me her first unhappiness. 
This much, you see, would never have been fitted 
Together, but for me. Why then is it 
They more and more neglect me? Late one sleepless 
Midsummer night I strained to keep 
Five tapers from your breathing. No, the widowed 
Cousin said, let them go out. I did. 
The room brimmed with gray sound, all the instreaming 
Muslin of your dream . . . 
Years later now, two of the grown grandchildren 
Sit with novels face-down on the sill, 
Content to muse upon your tall transparence, 
Your clouds, brown fields, persimmon far 
And cypress near. One speaks. How superficial 
Appearances are! Since then, as if a fish 
Had broken the perfect silver of my reflectiveness, 
I have lapses. I suspect 
Looks from behind, where nothing is, cool gazes 
Through the blind flaws of my mind. As days, 
As decades lengthen, this vision 
Spreads and blackens. I do not know whose it is, 
But I think it watches for my last silver 
To blister, flake, float leaf by life, each milling- 
Downward dumb conceit, to a standstill 
From which not even you strike any brilliant 
Chord in me, and to a faceless will, 
Echo of mine, I am amenable.
