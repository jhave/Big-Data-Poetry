The Two Times I Loved You the Most In a Car
****!****

It was your idea 
to park and watch the elephants 
swaying among the trees 
like royalty 
at that make-believe safari 
near Laguna.
I didn't know anything that big 
could be so quiet.

And once, you stopped 
on a dark desert road 
to show me the stars 
climbing over each other 
riotously
like insects
like an orchestra 
thrashing its way 
through time itself 
I never saw light that way 
again.
