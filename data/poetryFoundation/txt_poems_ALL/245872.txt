Sestina: Like
****!****

With a nod to Jonah Winter
Now we're all "friends,” there is no love but Like,
 A semi-demi goddess, something like
 A reality-TV star look-alike,
 Named Simile or Me Two. So we like
 In order to be liked. It isn't like
 There's Love or Hate now. Even plain "dislike”

 Is frowned on: there's no button for it. Like
 Is something you can quantify: each "like”
 You gather's almost something money-like,
 Token of virtual support. "Please like
 This page to stamp out hunger.” And you'd like
 To end hunger and climate change alike,

 But it's unlikely Like does diddly. Like
 Just twiddles its unopposing thumbs-ups, like-
 Wise props up scarecrow silences. "I'm like,
 So OVER him,” I overhear. "But, like,
 He doesn't get it. Like, you know? He's like
 It's all OK. Like I don't even LIKE

 Him anymore. Whatever. I'm all like ... ”
 Take "like” out of our chat, we'd all alike
 Flounder, agape, gesticulating like
 A foreign film sans subtitles, fall like
 Dumb phones to mooted desuetude. Unlike
 With other crutches, um, when we use "like,”

 We're not just buying time on credit: Like
 Displaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,
 Endangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click "like”
 If you're against extinction!) Like is like
 Invasive zebra mussels, or it's like
 Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike

 Redundant fast food franchises, each like
 (More like) the next. Those poets who dislike
 Inversions, archaisms, who just like
 Plain English as she's spoke -- why isn't "like”
 Their (literally) every other word? I'd like
 Us just to admit that's what real speech is like.

 But as you like, my friend. Yes, we're alike,
 How we pronounce, say, lichen, and dislike
 Cancer and war. So like this page. Click Like.
