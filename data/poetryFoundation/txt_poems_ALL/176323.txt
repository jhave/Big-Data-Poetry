The Wheels on the Bus
****!****

The wheels on the bus 
go round and round, 
Round and round, 
round and round. 
The wheels on the bus 
go round and round, 
All day long. 

The wipers on the bus go 
swish, swish, swish ... 

The horn on the bus goes 
beep!   beep!   beep! ... 

The people on the bus go 
chat, chat, chat ... 

The children on the bus 
bump up and down ...
