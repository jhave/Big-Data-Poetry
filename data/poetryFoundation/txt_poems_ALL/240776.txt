The Knife-Sharpener’s Daughter
****!****

A drain spout splashing
 rusty stains on concrete,
  
 the taste of doorknobs
 you kiss before squinting
  
 through the musty keyhole
 at the knife-sharpener's daughter,
  
 while across the city
 the knife-sharpener
  
 limps his pushcart
 with its dinging axles,
  
 with its screeching whetstone
 up wet alleys
  
 crying: scissors! knives! axes!
