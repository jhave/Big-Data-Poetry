The Geese
****!****

slicing this frozen sky know
where they are going--
and want to get there.

Their call, both strange 
and familiar, calls
to the strange and familiar

heart, and the landscape 
becomes the landscape
of being, which becomes 

the bright silos and snowy 
fields over which the nuanced
and muscular geese

are calling--while time 
and the heart take measure.
