What Is a Person
****!****

capable of feeling
while in contact with another?

I look at the red-tiled roofs outside,
at all the angles

facing the white-blue cloudless sky
like the creases in Bellini's angel's

silver-blue dress, Tintoretto's white one
that's practically transparent in his

Annunciazione at the San Rocco
-- cloth complex as thought!

Then the bells start, flood the void.
