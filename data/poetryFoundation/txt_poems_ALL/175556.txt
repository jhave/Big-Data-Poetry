How to Get RICHES

         PRECEPT I. 

In Things of moment, on thy self depend, 
Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend: 
With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair, 
And Servants very seldom prove sincere. 

       PRECEPT II. 

What can be done, with Care perform to Day, 
Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay; 
Your distant Prospects all precarious are, 
And Fortune is as fickle as she's fair. 

       PRECEPT III. 

Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise; 
Molehills, if often heap'd, to Mountains rise: 
Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste, 
Farthings long sav'd, amount to Pounds at last.
