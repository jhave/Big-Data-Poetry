A Blind Woman

She had turned her face up into 
a rain of light, and came on smiling. 

The light trickled down her forehead   
and into her eyes. It ran down 

into the neck of her sweatshirt 
and wet the white tops of her breasts. 

Her brown shoes splashed on 
into the light. The moment was like 

a circus wagon rolling before her 
through puddles of light, a cage on wheels, 

and she walked fast behind it,   
exuberant, curious, pushing her cane 

through the bars, poking and prodding,   
while the world cowered back in a corner.
