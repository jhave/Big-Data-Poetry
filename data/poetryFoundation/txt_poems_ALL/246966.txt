That was the week 
            it didn't stop snowing. 

That was the week 
             five-fingered trees fell 

             on houses & power lines 
             broke like somebody waiting 

for payday in a snowstorm. 
That snow week, my daughter 

& I trudged over the broken branches 
             fidgeting through snow 

              like hungry fingers through 
              an empty pocket. 

Over the termite-hollowed stump 
as squat as a flat tire. 

              Over the hollow 
             the fox dives into 
when we open the back door at night. 

That was the week of snow
              & it glittered like every 
              Christmas card we could 
              remember while my daughter 

poked around for the best place 
to stand a snowman. One 

with a pinecone nose. 
              One with thumb-pressed 

             eyes to see the whole 
picture once things warm up.
