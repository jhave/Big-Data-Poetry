Raking lace
at the fringe of the tide,
raking with fingers
the English and cutwork
and French of the froth,
with the negative black
dwarf sun in her eye echo
eye mirror eye, she, 
taking his fingers, 
English and Hebrew bones, 
bobbin bones, 
to lace with her own,
said love, if you like,
but abyss of light.
