Maya  Angelou
****!****
Awaking in New York
****!****

Curtains forcing their will   
against the wind, 
children sleep, 
exchanging dreams with   
seraphim. The city 
drags itself awake on   
subway straps; and 
I, an alarm, awake as a   
rumor of war, 
lie stretching into dawn,   
unasked and unheeded.
