Pangur Bán
****!****

From the ninth-century Irish poem
Pangur Bán and I at work, 
Adepts, equals, cat and clerk: 
       His whole instinct is to hunt, 
       Mine to free the meaning pent. 

More than loud acclaim, I love 
Books, silence, thought, my alcove. 
       Happy for me, Pangur Bán 
       Child-plays round some mouse's den. 

Truth to tell, just being here, 
Housed alone, housed together, 
       Adds up to its own reward: 
       Concentration, stealthy art. 

Next thing an unwary mouse 
Bares his flank: Pangur pounces. 
       Next thing lines that held and held 
       Meaning back begin to yield. 

All the while, his round bright eye 
Fixes on the wall, while I 
       Focus my less piercing gaze 
       On the challenge of the page. 

With his unsheathed, perfect nails 
Pangur springs, exults and kills. 
       When the longed-for, difficult
       Answers come, I too exult. 

So it goes. To each his own. 
No vying. No vexation. 
       Taking pleasure, taking pains, 
       Kindred spirits, veterans. 

Day and night, soft purr, soft pad, 
Pangur Bán has learned his trade. 
       Day and night, my own hard work 
       Solves the cruxes, makes a mark.
