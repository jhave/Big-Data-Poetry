About the dead having available to them
all breeds of knowledge,
some pure, others wicked, especially what is
future, and the history that remains 
once the waters recede, revealing the land 
that couldn't reject or contain it, and the land 
that is not new, is indigo, is ancient, lived 
as all the trees that fit and clothe it are lived, 
simple pine, oak, grand magnolia, he said 
they frighten him, that what they hold in their silences 
silences: sometimes a boy will slip 
from his climbing, drown but the myth knows why,
sometimes a boy will swing with the leaves.
