Voyage
****!****

I was the fourth ship.
          Behind Niña, Pinta, Santa María, 
          Lost at sea while watching a seagull, 
          Following the wind and sunset skies, 
          While the others set their charts.

I was the fourth ship.
          Breathing in salt and flying with clouds, 
          Sailing moonbreezes and starvision nights, 
          Rolling into the wave and savoring its lull, 
          While the others pointed their prows.

I was the fourth ship.
          Playfully in love with the sea, 
          Eternally entwined with the sky, 
          Forever vowed to my voyage, 
          While the others shouted "Land."
