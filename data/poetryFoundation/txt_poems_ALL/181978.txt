Linoleum and half a dozen eggs 
In 1960 
            Many towered Ilium 
A brand name and a shopping list too 

Memory distinguishes all things from 
Only nothing 
                   I was born and grew 
Rooms stacked up into houses 
A few trees (maples) welted in their seasons 
Wildly like sea birds in crude oil 
                                              What amazes 
Me now amazed me always but never 
Often eyesight is prophetic instantly 

Seeing broken eggs on the linoleum 
In the kitchen 1960 
I saw a broken lifetime further 
On as I see now my happy sister
