Mason Jars by the Window
****!****

Yes, but beyond happiness what is there? 
The question has not yet been answered. 
No great quotations have issued forth 
From there, we have no still photographs 
Full of men in fine leather hiking boots, 
Women with new-cut walking sticks.
   So yes, it is the realm of thin tigers 
Prowling, out to earn even more stripes; 
It is the smell of seven or eight perfumes 
Not currently available in America.
   Maybe this is wrong, of course.
The place may after all be populated,
Or over-populated, with dented trash cans 
In the streets and news of genital herpes
In every smart article in every slick magazine 
Everywhere in the place.
   But everybody there smiles--
Laughs, even, every time a breath can be caught. 
This is all true.
Beyond happiness, it's all the same, 
Things come back to where we are now. 
Of course maybe this is wrong,
But don't believe it: a happiness exists, 
All right, I have seen it for myself,
Touched it, touched the woman
Who with her daughter together keep 
Ammonia in Mason jars by the side window. 
They will throw it all in his face God 
Damn him if he ever comes close again.
