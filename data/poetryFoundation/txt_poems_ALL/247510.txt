****!****
Lychees
****!****

Terrace deep as the sky.
Stone bench where I sit and read,

I wandered by myself
Into the heart of the mountains of Yoshino.

In one hand a book, in the other, a bag made of newsprint--
No weather-beaten bones here

Just lychees bought in the market, 
Thirty rupees per kilogram.

Stalks mottled red tied up with string, 
Flesh the color of pigeon wings--

Sweet simmering. 
Sunlight bruises air

Pine trees blacken. 
Where shall I go?

The Dhauladhar peaks 
Are covered in snow.
