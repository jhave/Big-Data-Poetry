Everything Is Free
****!****

Wipe away tears,
Set free your fears:
Everything is free.
Only the lonely
Need much money:
Everything is free.
    Don't try to bind
The love you find:
Everyone is free.
Your lover's yours --
Surrender force:
Everyone is free.
    The sun melts down,
Spreads gold around:
Everything is free.
The rain is spent
Lending flowers scent:
Everything is free.
    The love you live,
The life you give:
Everything is free.
