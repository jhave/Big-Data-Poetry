The neck
                                of the flask
                           pitch black-getting bored
                                                    jacked
                                    also madness, insidious
              intended ghost
                                   (days late)
             I cross green & white flowered seas
     Valentines, May Day
                 conferring with henchman
 one must keep holy
                         the edges of fragments
                   slots used
           clothes loose
                               dried bloodspots
                                      bolster elegance
                              Found a goldmine
                                       outside a mansion
                                a prolongation
                    of the art
    of very rich hours
                           oil in 
                                       childe ballads
                                  sung, unsung against I should say
  "over” though,
               The Cosmos
            slows it for us
                                 The heretofore unmentioned
                                                   26th Series 
                                    (he gets the girl)
                                            sparks fall     call me
                                                             if you do die
