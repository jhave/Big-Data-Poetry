Shrugging shallowly down, burrowing
in beneath the heaps of plumped cork- and sallow-
brown leaf, beneath the oak and the brittle bean-

dripping locust and the still so innocent fruit 
trees--bare-boughed and newly blossoming--skinnily
shadowing the frost-seared grasses, I and my 

"now” [in this pictured perfect] four-
year-old daughter, huddled, hidden, lie
low. I remember hiding in the fort

too: bedtimes once how snug among books and the plush 
beasts we spoke the speech of angels. Now the world is huge-
ly hushed. The winter sky is hard, kiln-fired

blue. The cherry wood retouched with buds. And small,
untimely flowers like blood-drops on the snow.

Time lapsed. Time dwelt. There was nothing 
apparently to those rumors of rescue 
or reprisals. Absence only

emptied the mind. The fond heart felt
light--likewise lifted right and justly up
to praise the day as it was to high

heaven. You were a "find”: rare, rose-
lipped, hennaed, ochred, kohled, long black-
stockinged O like one of Schiele's urewig
girls, flashing a shy semaphore--

spelling eloquently out the f-
word, tenderly revisiting its history.
Lust--like love lost--was the catalyst:
exquisitely expedient, unchanged.
