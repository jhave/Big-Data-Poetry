                                                      1. FIELD


 Truck a passel (a poke) of wildling boys 

                                             We call ourselves (our pack) the orphan-slaves
 

 Upcountry -- loosed from mothers 

                                                                    Farmed out for scratch by mamas
 

 Pale (pink-backed) tobacco-crew 

                                       Bossed by peeled-stick (breakback) donkey-switch
 

 Tarred cropper-force 

                                                                                               Forced cropper-line
 Right far afield past Social Knob 

                                                                                 Dark welty field near Luris


                                      2. BUNKHOUSE 

 Most nights the boy they called Tynan 
suppered us with scrapple from a can. Or some black-eyes 
he'd've road-begged; a quarter-peck of crowders 
scrounged off vines.


The broad back-skin on the tallest boy 
   --a (spreading) welt-weave, a lattice.


Last good gloam-minute after work 
we'd strip off there in the side-yard, yawping; taking turns 
de-tarring      un-burning 
arc-aiming cool hose-spray each on each.


Eleven of us / chigger-scritches, scablets. 
Eleven of us / none of us clean.


Where the boss of us bore down 
on us -- our rank of   bedrolls on the floorboards -- one and 
one and one, eleven of us -- ranked sack-beds 
on floorboards -- boots of -- black breath of -- the boss


of us bearing down on us -- ain't none 
of us (not a one of us) clean.


                                        3. AFTER-ROAD

            And so (the heaving) boys got trucked to CANDY'S STOP
up Hwy. 52 one night and dumped.
