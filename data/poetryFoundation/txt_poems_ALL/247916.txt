Dream Song 76 (Henry's Confession)
****!****

Nothin very bad happen to me lately.
How you explain that? --I explain that, Mr Bones,
terms o' your bafflin odd sobriety.
Sober as man can get, no girls, no telephones,
what could happen bad to Mr Bones?
--If life is a handkerchief sandwich,

in a modesty of death I join my father
who dared so long agone leave me.
A bullet on a concrete stoop
close by a smothering southern sea 
spreadeagled on an island, by my knee.
--You is from hunger, Mr Bones,

I offers you this handkerchief, now set 
your left foot by my right foot,
shoulder to shoulder, all that jazz,
arm in arm, by the beautiful sea
hum a little, Mr Bones.
--I saw nobody coming, so I went instead.
