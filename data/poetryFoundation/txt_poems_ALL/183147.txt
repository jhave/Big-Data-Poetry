El Dorado

We have a friend in common, the retired sophomore.   
His concern: that I shall get it like that,   
in the right and righter of a green bush   
chomping on future considerations. In the ghostly   
dreams of others it appears I am all right,   
and even going on tomorrow there is much   
to be said on all these matters, "issues,” like   
"No rest for the weary.” (And yet--why not?)   
Feeling under orders is a way of showing up,   
but stepping on Earth--she's not going to.   
Ten shades of pleasing himself brings us to tomorrow   
evening and will be back for more. I disagree   
with you completely but couldn't be prouder   
and fonder of you. So drink up. Feel good for two.   

I do it in a lot of places. Subfusc El Dorado   
is only one that I know something about.   
Others are recently lost cities   
where we used to live--they keep the names   
we knew, sometimes. I do it in a lot of places.   
Brash brats offer laughing advice,   
as though anything I cared about could be difficult   
or complicated now. That's the rub. Gusts of up   
to forty-five miles an hour will be dropping in later   
on tonight. No reason not to. So point at the luck   
we know about. Living is a meatloaf sandwich.   
I had a good time up there.
