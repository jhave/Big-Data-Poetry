Small Moth

She's slicing ripe white peaches 
into the Tony the Tiger bowl 
and dropping slivers for the dog 
poised vibrating by her foot to stop their fall 
when she spots it, camouflaged, 
a glimmer and then full on-- 
happiness, plashing blunt soft wings 
inside her as if it wants 
to escape again.
