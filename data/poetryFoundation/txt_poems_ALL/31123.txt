Just Another Paradigm Shift
****!****

Just a shadow. Hardly that. But audible. 
Coming out of the woods, whispering 
Happily Ever After. 
                          Even in that light-- 
stars with the skeletons of animals 
and old friends-- 
                       visible 
to the eye behind the one always 
left open on the east side of the house, 
downhill. Where the coffee trees 
and hemp and the graves of old dogs lie, 
buried themselves in leaves and left 
to the sputtering wind of memory. 

& if that's not enough (he says 
to himself in the voice of a black-and-white 
actor whose name is a moth that keeps 
avoiding the tip of his flaming tongue) 
to bring you home, well, there 
it is again, 
              already exhausted 
by your efforts to make it 
comfortable 
enough to stay. Impatient, 
                                   already headed 
back down into the woods, whispering 
Once Upon A Time . . .
