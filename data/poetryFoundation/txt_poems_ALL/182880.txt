****!****

Keen and lovely man moved as in a dance 
to be considerate in lighted, glass-walled 
almost outdoor office. Business 

wasn't all he knew. He knew music, art. 
Had a heart. "With eyes like yours I should think 
the dictaphone” or did he say the flute? 

His sensitivity--it stopped you. 
And the neighbors said "She's taking lessons 
on the dictaphone” as tho it were a saxophone. 

He gave the job to somebody else.
