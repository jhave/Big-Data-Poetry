Windy City
****!****

The garments worn in flying dreams 
were fashioned there-- 
overcoats that swooped like kites, 
scarves streaming like vapor trails, 
gowns ballooning into spinnakers. 

In a city like that one might sail 
through life led by a runaway hat. 
The young scattered in whatever directions 
their wild hair pointed, and gusting 
into one another, fell in love. 

At night, wind rippled saxophones 
that hung like windchimes in pawnshop 
windows, hooting through each horn 
so that the streets seemed haunted   
not by nighthawks, but by doves.   

Pinwheels whirled from steeples 
in place of crosses. At the pinnacles 
of public buildings, snagged underclothes-- 
the only flag--flapped majestically. 
And when it came time to disappear 

one simply chose a thoroughfare 
devoid of memories, raised a collar, 
and turned his back on the wind. 
I closed my eyes and stepped 
into a swirl of scuttling leaves.
