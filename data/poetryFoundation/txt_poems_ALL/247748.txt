Song of the Andoumboulou: 138

  Anuncio drifted in a well of sound, unlay's
     ward, late orphan, a wry erotics had its 
way. He called himself Antonio now, Ahdja
                                                                                having
    joined our group...    Dunelike hip and thigh
he stipulated, the desert he insisted we see. We
   understood there was occult stuff going on
                                                                                  un-
      derneath, telling ourselves get used to it,
   close to the bone so close it lay inside, the
     closer walk we all went on about...    We
were in Port of  Spain thinking about India,
                                                                               bored
    outside the Red House, shimmering side
street, pan exactitude bruited elsewhere, pan's
   light water, floating light. The light hung as
                                                                                   though 
it were buffed, embroidered, sound's amanuensis,
     griff...    There they were at the well again, the
   we he'd been told would be there, whatsaid
                                                                                   en-
       semble the air disinterred, hit by affliction
   in each their own way, beset by some other
    where there might've been, beset by some other
when there might've been, beset by some nether
                                                                                         light...    
   If not bodily light's late day there was nothing,
     the not-all-there there'd always been come into
its own. Wind affliction was all, all there was,
                                                                                   rent,
    a mere liplike wrinkle at least. "Back when we
were alive,” it said...    Literal sigil. Sage regret.
   A way of  looking. Something we saw. "Sealed
                                                                                       lips
    wheeled in the air,” we translated it. The point
                                                                                          was
  to look past it we
saw


                         • 


    He wanted Ahdja's poise, Antonio's aplomb, 
      namesake demur, name notwithstanding. So it 
was he blinked and his eyes bled, wry erotics' 
  haunched interstice bloodstruck, never again 
                                                                                     be- 
fit, Mr. In-Between... A kaiso chorale, we sang 
    "Namaste,” a voice inside the voice inside the 
  box, tongue in cheek, box buried somewhere 
                                                                                    east... 
      It wasn't singing we were there for, chant 
  though we did sotto voce, an agonized aplomb of 
    some sort... An Ibibio go-head we each turned 
into, not meaning to... Go-heads one and all we 
                                                                                       were, 
    snide choir... To sing wasn't why we were there... 
What it was was names tore loose, took wing, what 
  world had been ours theirs now, sound itself, 
                                                                                      A- 
nuncio's well's regress... So that what we sought 
    was more tone, mock sonance, science an a- 
  malgam of huh, wuh, huh, knowing's new toll, 
                                                                                       wuh 
huh... We were where the songs had been beckon- 
    ing from. This was as it always was. This was 
  always it no matter what it was. All the things it 
                                                                                         was 
      lay nameless. Roots drew loose with no tonic, 
  it whether or not it was... An aroused incumbency 
    surrounded us, unlay's fallaway terrain's intan- 
gibility, Antonio's adjunct address. We were down 
                                                                                             to 
    the it of it it seemed... Was it the shimmer of last 
      things we wondered, queasiness come and gone 
  come again. There the very it so what it was our knees 
                                                                                                     gave, 
    so close we could taste it, nonce elixir, lapse, ellipse... 
All of which Ahdja made light of, unsure what of it 
  fit or if any of it fit. "You can't come on with all 
                                                                                        that 
    new-name talk, that no-name stuff. All that evac- 
uation stuff,” she said, "gets old, got old,” as Antonio 
  carried on, kept on, Anuncio to some of us, even 
                                                                                           so... 
    All as if the quality of standing there shifted, a new 
                                                                                                 cast 
  of soul come 
down

  Some common body to adduce it would some- 
    day come to. We stood on the dock, white 
clouds, blue sky all around, spiked Antillean 
                                                                                  salt 
    in the air. Big ships loomed as we talked... 
Each of us with our well of sound, a sense of 
  quest and of brute inconsequence, Anuncio's 
                                                                                     mys- 
tic pretense. "Promises, promises,” we said suck- 
    ing our teeth, said sucking wind thru the gaps 
  between our teeth, a taunt song serenading Mr. 
                                                                                         In- 
      Between... We stood looking out, disconsolate, 
  nothing if not words for recompense, what if not 
    words none of us knew. Words more whistle 
than words we admonished, Anuncio going on 
                                                                                      a- 
      bout Antonio and Ahdja, the he and she of 
  lore they'd have been had they been able, each 
    the other's butterfly twin... Each the other's 
                                                                                    but- 
  terfly friend if not all that, paperweight, open, 
    flown. Second-, third-, nth-hand innuendo all 
there was, word more whistle, mere whistle we 
                                                                                      let 
      loose, echo degree zero, choric sough... Black 
  wheeze, occult burr, we susurrated. "Este mundo 
    tan extraño,” she intoned, we as well. Ahdja 
                                                                                    was 
      meat and bones on the spirit of place he con- 
  vinced us existed, an impromptu polity exhumed... 
    The feeling we were futureless went away. Wuh 
                                                                                           huh 
  went as 
well

  An inwardly repeated tableau. We sat on the 
    dock, reluctant witnesses it seemed, more 
story to the story than we could see. What 
                                                                             we 
    thought real got a gossamer look, soon to 
      tear thru it seemed. Lytic remit what we'd 
been told was real, brute reconnoiter, non- 
  sonant lament it seemed... There we stood, 
                                                                                 toll- 
      ing bone in the air, no tone. Huff called it 
  skeletone. There we sat though we stood, 
    stood though we sat, stark Trinidadian light 
                                                                                     a 
  new life, shoal of an earlier life... I wanted 
      Anuncio's ythmic pivot, Ahdja's mystic sa- 
    shay, Antonio's pirate swag rolled into one 
                                                                                  but 
      no one was asking me. No one was noticing 
  anything, I thought, the difference Ahdja made 
    no matter, an order of self-containment ob- 
tained. So I thought or would've said I thought 
                                                                                      had 
    anyone asked. No one did, said or saw... An 
      illusion of place or an allusion to it, Mu was 
  all there was, unmoored abstract integument, 
                                                                                      im- 
    manent commemorative lament. Something 
known as la-la crowded my throat, clung to 
  the roof of my mouth. La-la meant I loved it, 
                                                                                    torn 
      but tucked away, the versionary company of 
  love I'd fallen in with, first unfallen fallen, unre- 
    formed... No time soon will I be done with it 
I thought. La-la mentored my disarray. No way 
                                                                                      can 
      I be done with it I thought, Ahdja and Antonio 
  Anuncio's boon constituency, each the other's 
    go-head eminence, each the other's glancing 
                                                                                      re- 
lay... Late that day we sat in a small boat on the 
    other side of the island. Scarlet ibises got their 
  color eating shrimp Ahdja pointed out. Anuncio, 
                                                                                           not 
      knowing what to say, said, "So my heart...” Mu 
  was not knowing. Mu meant shutting up. Mu was 
    me and Ahdja, Mr. and Ms. In-Between. Mu 
meant no filler. "Promises, promises” resounded 
                                                                                          all 
  day... Something we saw in Ahdja's face wanted 
    out it seemed. She was the one we had by not 
having lore had it, love's adamant outskirts, love's 
                                                                                           dog- 
    matic heart. I made untimeliness a foregone future, 
something-seen-in-a-face a new order to restore. I 
  saw gold where there maybe wasn't, beer cans lined 
                                                                                                 on 
    the rail we leaned against, aught if not imagined im- 
        pact, we the presumption of one... A long sus- 
      tention of hum it came down to, Om the Vedic nu 
                                                                                                 we 
    reminisced, Om the seed-syllabic gist and embel- 
      lishment, Om the intuitist Mu. "Greek to me,” 
each of us admitted, thrum we were ambushed by, 
  glum subterranean drone strung under it, mosquito 
                                                                                                 buzz 
    athwart it 
  all





             ________________

    I dreamt I died and I went into an isolation 
booth, a quiz box I dug my breath up in. "Please 
  call me Antonio,” I whispered, head against 
                                                                                  the 
      hardness of the bone beneath her breast, an 
  anacrustic psalm, a new "Dearly Beloved.” 
    What to say but there was nothing to, wag as 
                                                                                      much 
  we might... Something of which we had a name 
      if nothing else. Something for which we had 
    the name if nothing else. Something for which 
                                                                                         we 
      had a name if nothing else. Something of which 
                                                                                              we
    had the name if nothing 
  else

  Accompaniment called out to me in dreams 
    I woke wincing from. In its grip, in the 
giving of it something new came out, a new

      old something the thought of which made 
  me weep, the very thought of it I thought I 
    knew... But who really knew I wondered,
