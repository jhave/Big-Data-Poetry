were some quite creepy men -- one 
used to lie down
on the dayroom floor, then get us all 
to pile on top of him -- and a basilisk-
eyed matron in a blue uniform with a watch 
dangling 
beneath her right
collarbone. Thump thump
thump went her footsteps, making 
the asbestos ceiling tiles quiver, and me
want to hide, or run like a rabbit
in a fire . . .
                    What we lost, we lost
forever. A minor 
devil played at chess 
with us, forcing 
the pieces to levitate 
and hover, flourishing swords, in midair. I'd grasp 
them now, the orotund bishop, the stealthy
knight, the all-
knowing queen, 
but they dissolve
in my fingers, refuse 
to return to the board, to their squares.
