Lord
          sho been good to me
  
                  My loved hoe handle, and my sweat,
 heart pounding and the towhee singing.
  
          Jill, jerking the hospital sheets,
                "Damn careless nurses    ...    
 "But golly    ...    a good life.
        "That student who kept writing me.
                 "That rainy picnic by a road in Burgundy.
 "Heart thumping, thumping on    ...    more, more....”
  
                  A squirrel on a post.
 The nutgrooved skull
          drops; he claws the dirt.
                  Next winter!
 Frost thrown down,
          a stiffened morning,
                  a harsh corrective herb
 to gnaw, take in.
  
          Sho been, Lord, Sho been
  
                  Whether born of  kiss sublime,
 victim's terror, rapist crime, and
          however ending,
                  nut-gnawers nulled
 inscrutably, or
          Caesars,
                  soldiers, friends
 lammed open-eyed --
  
          Lord, good...sho been
