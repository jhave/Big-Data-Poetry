What To Do
****!****

Places we leave 
slick our bodies 
with silky air   
or foam we feel 
faithful and tickly 
(even somehow taste) 
but can't clearly see. 
We wear its weight 
like atmosphere-- 
runs, blots 
of what we've done   
in and with   
each place   
--what to do 
with it now?-- 
and what it does 
to us still.
