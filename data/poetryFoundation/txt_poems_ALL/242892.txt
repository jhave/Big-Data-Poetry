Time of Need

In the road, a dog. Days dead, 
that dog. Liliana was walking beside me awhile 
(I am sure) and I was almost not crying but then found 

what I was looking for. 
She heaved it for me--all of it, the stench, the weight--
in her thin arms until it was too much. 

Tired, she dragged the thing by its wasted paws 
all the way home. Her dress was stained. This is how 

I learned about love. She did not mind at all 
the silent, steady distance I placed between us.
