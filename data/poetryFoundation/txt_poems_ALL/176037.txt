When the cow died by the green sapling,   
her limp udder splayed on the grass   
like something from the sea, we offered   
our words in their low calibrations-- 
which was our fashion--then severed   
her horns with a pug-toothed blade   
and pounded them out to an amber   
transparency, two sheets that became, 
in their moth-wing haze, our parlor windows.   
They softened our guests with the gauze-light   
of the Scriptures, and rendered to us,   
on our merriest days, the sensation   
of gazing through the feet of a gander.   
In time we moved up to the status   
of glass--one pane, then two--each   
cupping in proof of its purity 
a dimple of fault, a form of distortion   
enhancing our image. We took the panes   
with us from cottage to cottage,   
moth-horn and glass, and wedged up   
the misfitted gaps with a poultice   
of gunny and wax. When woodsmoke   
darkened our bricks, we gave 
to the windowsills a lacquer 
of color--clear blue with a lattice 
of yellow: a primary entrance and exit   
for light. And often, walking home   
from the river and small cheese shop, 
we would squint their colors to a sapling   
green, and remember the hull 
of that early body, the slap of fear 
we suffered there, then the little wash   
of recovery that is our fashion--how 
we stroked to her bones a cadenced droning,   
and took back from her absence, our 
amber, half-literal method of sight.
