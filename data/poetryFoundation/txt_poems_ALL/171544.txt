After Midnight
****!****

The dark streets are deserted,   
With only a drugstore glowing   
Softly, like a sleeping body; 

With one white, naked bulb   
In the back, that shines   
On suicides and abortions. 

Who lives in these dark houses?   
I am suddenly aware   
I might live here myself. 

The garage man returns 
And puts the change in my hand,   
Counting the singles carefully.
