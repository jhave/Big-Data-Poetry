From "The First, at the Last"
****!****

All he undertook
goes under, under
the undergrowth he rose from
fly-boy, lovely
in his day. 
All his clothes
-- spruce suit & tie --
are underclothes
against ungrounded gray.
All his studies understudy
an unstudied play.
  
           Under the under
          of what I remember
          we are both twenty
          and except with each other
          underemployed.

                 It is summer.
                Under our butter, bread,
                summer's hunger satisfied.
