For Weeks After the Funeral
****!****

The house felt like the opera, 
the audience in their seats, hushed, ready, 
but the cast not yet arrived. 

And if I said anything 
to try to appease the anxious air, my words 
would hang alone like the single chandelier 

waiting to dim the auditorium, but still 
too huge, too prominent, too bright, its light 
announcing only itself, bringing more 

emptiness into the emptiness.
