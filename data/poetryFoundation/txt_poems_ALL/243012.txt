Editing the Moon

Be precise
 authority is magic.
 When you think you've got it straight
 wax wane declination
 feel the movement under your hand
 one summer morning
 as you observe it set
 then rise that night.
 Always use a well-sharpened pencil
 followed by a good eraser.
 Watch the white emerge.
