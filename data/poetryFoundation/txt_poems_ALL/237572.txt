for Deshawn, Eric, Dallas, Jerome & Lerone
We brown boys
           play
                      stick games,
           say
                      nicknames
 like BIG D, EVIL E;
 and conjure Knievel
 with jigsawed dirt bikes
 and sewer curbs
 for asphalt launch pads.
           We all sweat
           to know flight
           for just
           a minute.

 We brown boys,
           hair
                      all knaps,  
           wear
                      ballcaps'
 broken brims. Broken rims
 from hungry slamdunks,
 pro-ball pipe dreams
 over ice cream man's
 "Pop Goes the Weasel.”
           We all hunt
           change from cords',
           Bermudas
           and mamas.

 We brown boys--
           smack
                     talking
           slap
                     boxing--
 stay bragging and bagging,
 drinking summer from hoses
 and water bomb barrages.
 We throw rocks at garages
 making no dents.
          We all just
           trying to leave
           a mark.
