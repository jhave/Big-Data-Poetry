Pain in the House
****!****

Feeling her head pick up her body,
          question mark,
          blurred misstamped question mark
          snakes out of   bed,
          trying to  jiggle unhappiness
          as little as possible,
          not to wake pain,
          not to raise a shade,
          if  raising a shade in the dark wakes pain.
 Under the shade the stars are awake, smiling --
          ready to frown on unhappiness.
 And the happiness of  the unconscious
          is scurrying already
          from the knife-edge of   light,
          pain's night-light,
          waiting under the door across the hall.
 Dread's square hair stiffens,
          her feet have corners,
          trying to trick the stairs out of their creaking,
          and the house out of  groaning before coffee,
          before resurrection.
 Death before resurrection is hard;
          breakfast and the stars belong first;
          plenty of  time to die all day
          when everything does groan, and unhappiness
          shakes itself out like a musty old mare
          all over the house.
 Dread says to herself: Serves me right
          for leaving home, for learning to read;
          serves me right for children and menopause
          and cosmetic surgery, and elation in gin.
                                       I must travel back
          through the shade and the black holes and the frowns,
          through drink and tampon and alphabet
          to the kitchen and mother and dad and
          the morning of  the resurrection was the first day.
