First Light
****!****

Spiders in the cold, 
bees in inarticulate bunches 
hang from a day's work. 
Waiting for light they wait 
to see what they will be. 
A tree lets down
green undersides and is maple. 
A window glints--
a thing of saffron
kindles with singlehood.
In the broad yard
each thing dandles
its blue, its name, its consequence.
