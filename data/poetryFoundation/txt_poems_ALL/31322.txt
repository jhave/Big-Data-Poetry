Merry-No-Round
****!****

The wooden horses
are tired of their courses

and plead from head to hoof 
to be fed to a stove--

In leaping lunging flames 
they'd rise again, flared manes

snapping like chains behind them. 
The smoke would not blind them

as do these children's hands: 
beyond our cruel commands

the fire will free them then 
as once the artisan when

out of the tree they
were nagged to this neigh.
