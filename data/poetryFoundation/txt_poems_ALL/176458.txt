Sounding Chinese at Inspiration Point
****!****

Nice spring day off big white cloud
At Inspiration Point escaping time wars
Poet takes book & wine bottle up into Mist Mountains

Since only available agenda is rhyming with silence 
Seeking window of opportunity on a wall 
I disguise what I have to say by sounding Chinese

Such as stars are now darker and farther away 
They take deeper drinks because space is 
Drying out afraid to think own thoughts

Administered citizen achieving condition of robot 
In public mind things not so good these days 
Nor in wrong run will it matter to Tu Fu
