It Would
****!****

it would be that 
but only if I knew how 
    again 
            Could something like   
      that get lost?    no only   
         a little a little lost 

            
      but if only I remember   
      how I mean she or I 
         oh a freight train goes by   
    & they always do & did 
          do 
             I mean a real one too   
         that I'm not on & am it   
                very seriously 

                  
         in this serious love world   
       that one 
      where something oddly music   
            will pass through your   
          night 
                  and it will be me   
             sweet me
