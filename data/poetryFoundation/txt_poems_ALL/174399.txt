Music when Soft Voices Die (To --)
****!****

   Music, when soft voices die,

Vibrates in the memory--

Odours, when sweet violets sicken,

Live within the sense they quicken.


   Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,

Are heaped for the belovèd's bed;

And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,

Love itself shall slumber on.
