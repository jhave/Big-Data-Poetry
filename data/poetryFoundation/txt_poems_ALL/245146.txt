If You’re Crowish
****!****

If  you're crowish and you know it
give a caw

Caaaw

If  you're weighted and you bear it
send a moo

Moooo

If  you're owl and you dreamed it,
give a hoo

Hoooo

If  you're thirsty and you mean it
breathe an ahhh

Ahhhh

You are putty in my hands

said the wind 

to the stone 

said the dawn 

to the bloom 

said the dark 

to the moon.
