Twelfth Song of Thunder [Navajo Tradition]
****!****

The voice that beautifies the land! 
 The voice above,
 The voice of thunder
 Within the dark cloud 
 Again and again it sounds,
 The voice that beautifies the land. 
  
 The voice that beautifies the land! 
 The voice below,
 The voice of the grasshopper 
 Among the plants 
 Again and again it sounds,
 The voice that beautifies the land.
