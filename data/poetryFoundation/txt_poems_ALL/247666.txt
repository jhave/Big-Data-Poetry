Xochiquetzal  Candelaria
****!****
The Only Thing I Imagine Luz Villa Admires about Her Husband’s Gun–
****!****

is the six-chambered cylinder,
the spinnable heart,
how it clicks into place,

lonely but strong by design.
She understands its negative worth,
how it holds in the dark

and withstands what is held,
how it burns and smells
of smoke when left and left and left.
