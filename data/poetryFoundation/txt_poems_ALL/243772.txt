Six Lines for Louise Bogan
****!****

All that has tamed me I have learned to love
        and lost that wildness that was once beloved.

All that was loved I've learned to tame
        and lost the beloved that once was wild.

All that is wild is tamed by love--
        and the beloved (wildness) that once was loved.
