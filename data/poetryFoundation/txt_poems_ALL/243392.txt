This timeless blood was here before begat.
     Infinity runs in your veins--
        Not mine, nor yours,
             Nor Eve's, not Adam's--
                  Gat of God,
                       And spinning like taffy Godwards back again.
Sapped through the centuries to us--
     Grafting a limb there for the Jesse tree--
        Remultiplied infinitely,
             From heart to heart tick-pulsed,
                  Ill clad, ill fed, ill fit--
                       Here, child, do what you can with it.
