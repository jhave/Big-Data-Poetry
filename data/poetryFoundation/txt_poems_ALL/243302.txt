Audubon at Oakley Plantation

I need them true to life
 and so I shoot them,
 as many as fill the field at dawn,
 and then fix wires
 to prop them as if feeding their young
 or bending to the river.
  
 Why make a little book
 when they exist life-sized,
 can be etched to stand high as my hip?
 Often have I wished
 I had eight pairs of hands to hold them,
 and another body for the gun.
