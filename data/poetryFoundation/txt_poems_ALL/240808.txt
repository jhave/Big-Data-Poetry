The kids should visit a history museum 
in their senior year, to understand disgrace as 
one form of Clinton's victory. On the other hand 
the European Community foreign debt gives 
everybody bad dreams. So we do need to solve 
the problem of students reading difficult things 
that will lead them astray: why did Rimbaud 
turn from socialism to capitalism? As if 

it matters. He is his own consolation prize.
We'd be delighted to have his uniform. 
We want to see all the modern art stuff, too. 
Thank you. Press the button marked "monument”
and see what happens: a recorded voice says 
"I have wasted my life,” and we pay to listen.
