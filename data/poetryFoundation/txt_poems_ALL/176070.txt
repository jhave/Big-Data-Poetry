...and a decrepit handful of trees. 
--Aleksandr Pushkin 

And I matured in peace born of command, 
in the nursery of the infant century, 
and the voice of man was never dear to me, 
but the breeze's voice--that I could understand. 
The burdock and the nettle I preferred, 
but best of all the silver willow tree. 
Its weeping limbs fanned my unrest with dreams; 
it lived here all my life, obligingly. 
I have outlived it now, and with surprise. 
There stands the stump; with foreign voices other 
willows converse, beneath our, beneath those skies, 
and I am hushed, as if I'd lost a brother.
