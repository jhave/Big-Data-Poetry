On the Ground
****!****

When the collie saw the child
break from the crowd,

he gave chase, and since they both
were border-crossers,

they left this world. 
We were then made of--

affronted by--silence.
The train passed Poste 5, Paris,

late arrival, no luck, no
enlarging commentary

magnified in any glass.
"The ineffable

is everywhere in language”
the speaker had said 

in the huge hall where 
I sat amongst coughers, 

students, in the late 
February of that year,

at the end of a sinuous 
inquiry on sense and sound--

"and very close to the ground,” he'd said. 
Like mist risen above

the feet of animals
in a far field north of here.
