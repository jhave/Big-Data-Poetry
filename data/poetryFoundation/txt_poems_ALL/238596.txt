Impromptu

First there was Jim, clamping to my long black hair
             that nine-pound Cleopatra wig 
             with nylon bands and bobbie pins.

Meanwhile I was on fire for Chad, who coached me
             a bit impatiently Tuesday nights
             on my Joan-of-Arc inflection.

Then Terence said I'd be perfect for the lounge-singer-
             turned-whore, and as it turned out
             that was a fairly easy gig.

Max signed me on soon after, claiming I was a natural
             for Eternally Aggrieved Girl,
             which in hindsight hurts me deeply.

So by the time you followed me back to the green room
             to wait in the hallway--whistling!--
             for my scrubbed face to emerge,

naturally I was wary, waiting for the script 
             you never bothered to come up with.
             It was damned awkward sitting there,

nothing but milkshakes between us. Maybe, I thought, 
             you'd assumed I was the one with a script.  
             Finally I decided to give Terence a call.

I didn't like the way you looked at me so steadily
             with your chin resting on one fist,
             as if the table were a table, the boards

A floor. Listening there as if you meant it, 
             as if something I could say were true, and every
             moment from now on would be my cue.
