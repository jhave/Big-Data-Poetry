Some things become such a part of us that we forget them.

                                                               •

I want because of what I wanted, and what I wanted, I wouldn't want again.

                                                               •

The passing of a soul is light, extremely light, almost silence.

                                                                •

 There are pains that have lost their memory and don't remember why they are painful.

                                                                •

Convince me, but without convictions. Convictions no longer convince me.

                                                                •

We don't forgive being as we are.

                                                                •

At the last moment, my whole life will last a moment.

                                                               •

Man is a thing children learn. A childish thing.

                                                               •

Don't speak to me. I want to be with you.

                                                               •

 There are those fallen who don't get up so as not to fall again.

                                                               •

 The dream that doesn't feed on dream vanishes.
