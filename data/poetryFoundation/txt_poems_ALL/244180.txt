Turkey Fallen Dead from Tree
****!****

Startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor's mutt, 
it banged its buzzard's head then couldn't solve 
the problem of the white pine's limbs 
with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. 
Somewhere an awkward angel knows 
whether it was dead before it hit the ground.
Any sinner could tell it was dead after--
eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids,
feet drawn up almost as high as hands.
I loved to watch thistle and millet 
disappear beneath it in the yard.
As snow covers feathers that will still be 
iridescent in the spring I remember seeing 
a businessman take a dripping handful 
of pocket change and throw it down 
a subway grate beside a homeless man. 
The coins bounced and clattered, vanishing 
in the humid dark. The rich man said 
now you're having a shitty day too. 
But it's not a shitty day and won't be 
when I retrieve the bird and walk it--
toes curling stiff from a shopping bag--
to a houseless scrap of oak savannah 
birdseed drew it from and dig it 
into deeper snow so what was hoarded 
by a man may by the thaw be doled.
