Inside, inside the return, inside, the hero diminishes.
 Over her vessel they place a veil, and when it is lifted
 the name of the vessel has been lost. Consider
 the darkness of the water which has no scent
 and neither can it swallow. Yet the ship's bow
 extends over the proscenium like a horse
 at a fence and the orchestra stands and files out.
 On the long walk home, I long to see your face.
