A Vagabond
****!****

A vagabond is a newcomer 

in a heap of trouble.

He's an eyeball at a peephole 

that should be electrocuted. 

He's a leper in a textile mill

and likely to be beheaded, I mean,

given a liverwurst sandwich 

on the break by the brook 

where the loaves are sliced. 

But he oughtn't meddle

with the powder puffs on the golf links--

they have their own goats to tame, 

dirigibles to situate.

He can act like an imbecile 

if the climate is propitious, 

a magnate of kidnap

paradising around the oily depot, 

or a speck from a distant nebula

wishing to purchase a certain skyscraper ....


Well, if it's permitted, then 

let's regulate him, let's testify

against his thimble, and moderate his gloves 

before they sew an apron.


The local minister is thinking

of moving to Holland, exchanging

his old ballads for some lingerie.

“Zatso!” says the vagabond.

Homeless, like wheat that tattletales 

on the sermon, like wages swigged.

“Zatso, zatso, zatso!” cries the vagabond. 

The minister reels under the weight

of his thumbs, the vagabond seems to have

jutted into his kernel, disturbed

his terminal core. Slowly, and with 

trifling dignity, the minister removes 

from his lapel his last campaign button: 

Don't Mess with Raymond, New Hampshire.
