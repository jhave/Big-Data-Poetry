Imagine having enough left 
to break a bottle over it. 
Listen how pretty, listen 

for glass in nothing nearby 
shattering, just morning birds 
that do not wake whoever

is not sleeping. Come here

No matter how great the gains 

so many complaints hang--
The grass full of worms, 
and still all that squawking, 

like a couple talking and talking 
about never talking. The chatter
of hunger, that gaudy red--
