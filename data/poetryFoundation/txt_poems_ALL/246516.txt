hearing all bells at 
                               once instructs the final exhale
                               Camelot in thimble of  the gods
                              Marilyn Monroe's ambulance
lost on the way to the palace of  temperament
a branch of government for the magical arts
                               punch wall of forest for
                               an oaken
                               desk
                               another dream we 
                               needed agitating the
               sentence as it rows across a
                newly destroyed heart folding
                following tormenting one another
                              we were all once young and
                               beautiful squandering everything
                               it's what we came here to do
                               cut off engines to the child
                               registering disposition of the 
                               cat in the dark as the 
                               size of the darkness
