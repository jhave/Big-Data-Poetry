Drifting at Midday

Now I can see: even the trees 
are tired: they are bones bent forward 

in a skin of wind, leaning in 
osteoporosis, reaching 

for a little more than any 
oxygen can give: when living 

is in season, they can live; 
but living is no reason 

to continue: everything begins: 
and everything is desperate 

to extend: and everything is 
insufficient in the end: 

and everything is ending: 
Now I can see: even the trees
