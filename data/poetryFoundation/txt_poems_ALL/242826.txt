Epiphany
****!****

A momentary rupture to the vision: 
the wavering limbs of a birch fashion

the fluttering hem of the deity's garment, 
the cooling cup of coffee the ocean the deity

waltzes across. This is enough--but sometimes
the deity's heady ta-da coaxes the cherries 

in our mental slot machine to line up, and
our brains summon flickering silver like 

salmon spawning a river; the jury decides
in our favor, and we're free to see, for now. 

A flaw swells from the facets of a day, increasing
the day's value; a freakish postage stamp mails

our envelope outside time; hairy, claw-like
magnolia buds bloom from bare branches; 

and the deity pops up again like a girl from 
a giant cake. O deity: you transfixing transgressor,

translating back and forth on the border
without a passport. Fleeing revolutions 

of same-old simultaneous boredom and 
boredom, we hoard epiphanies under the bed, 

stuff them in jars and bury them in the backyard; 
we cram our closet with sunrise; prop up our feet 

and drink gallons of wow!; we visit the doctor 
because all this is raising the blood's levels of 

c6h3(oh)2chohch2nhch3, the heart caught 
in the deity's hem and haw, the oh unfurling 

from our chest like a bee from our cup of coffee, 
an autochthonous greeting: there. Who saw it?
