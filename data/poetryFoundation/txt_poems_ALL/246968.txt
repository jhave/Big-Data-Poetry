This sunlight on snow. 

This decrescendo
of covered stumps & brush --
stop for it. 

Stop before the sled end-
              over-ends down 
              the chin of the hill --

the way it always will 
at the rock ⅔ of the way down. 

Stop & shiver in it: the ring 
              of snow inside gloves, 
              the cusp of red forehead 

like a sun just waiting to top 
the hill. Every ill-built 

              snowball waiting to be thrown, 
              every bell-shaped angel 

stamped over the brown leaves. 
When my daughter ranges 
              in winter, she works 

every dazzling angle --
              the crestfallen pinecones, 

             the grizzled beards 
of bushes in the morning, 

a furnace's windup huffing
              in this throat-
              clearing of snow.
