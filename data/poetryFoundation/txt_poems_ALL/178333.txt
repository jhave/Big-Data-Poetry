An Argument
****!****

When you said that you wanted to be useful 
as the days of the week, I said, "God bless you.”   
Then you said you would not trade our Mondays,   
useful for two thousand years, 
for the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.   
I said, "Endless are the wonders 
to which I can only say ‘ah,' that our ‘Ah'   
who art in heaven can easily become the   
‘ah, ah' that comforts a baby.” Then you said,   
"Go make a living on metaphors for ‘ah,'”   
that I, a lunatic, secretly want to be 
the Lighthouse of Alexandria, 
a fifty-story-high collaboration 
of art and science, a mirror of light 
that might be seen five or ten days out to sea,   
Poseidon standing on my shoulders, 
the Library of Alexandria at my back,   
all the wonders of Greek Africa. 
I said, "Today is Monday. I want little more   
than to be a hand-mirror my wife carries   
in her purse with a hankie 
to stop my hemorrhaging humility.”
