Autumn
****!****

The rusty leaves crunch and crackle, 
Blue haze hangs from the dimmed sky, 
The fields are matted with sun-tanned stalks -- 
Wind rushes by. 

The last red berries hang from the thorn-tree, 
The last red leaves fall to the ground. 
Bleakness, through the trees and bushes, 
Comes without sound.
