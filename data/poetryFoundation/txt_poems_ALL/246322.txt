When you said no, 
             I went for your dresser, 
opened the top drawer, 
             broke the paper seals 
on the two sterile cups, 
             and wiped my dirty 
thumbs inside. 

             Because our stubborn love 
won't die, I have to kill it, 
            will it dead. Or so 
I thought until I passed 
             a cycle on my own. 
You've no idea 
             what's grown 
inside me
             since I bled.
