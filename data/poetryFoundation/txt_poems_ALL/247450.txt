Consequences of the Laws of Thermodynamics
****!****

When Albert Murray said
the second law adds up to
the blues that in other words
ain't nothing nothing he meant it

not quite the way my pops says
nomads don't show emotions
but more how my grandmother
warned that men like women

with soft hands blood red
nails like how Mingus meant
truth if  you had time for it
facts if  you got no time that

years pass. Zero
one two three and
the man you used

to flirt with you can
no longer flirt with
thank goodness.

He's now a man
you can't wear
your  jaw out on

about weather
news or work

a perfect
strawberry

buried
beneath

a peck.
