Estrangement in Athens
****!****

Mount Olympus held nothing for them. 
No occasion of theirs could provoke 
Magniloquent debate. Nor act require 
That attic of gods to come swooping 
Onto the field, swaying the battle. 
Only the great booming of the ferry 
As it shouldered alongside the pier; 
Only the waitress counting their 
Saucers: it was this April morning 
That swung them by their heels. 
What was missing was the impersonal, 
The fated, a visionary marble address, 
The goddess skimming over blue water 
To whisper good news, or some stud, 
Swan, or bull brimming with light. 
Not a wingéd foot. Only Love, 
Recently decamped, hovered above 
The table, ready to be splendid. 
But their ten years' war had ended.
