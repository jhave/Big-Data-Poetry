Hippogriff
****!****

To look at this fictitious steed 
You'd think some mixed-up farmer 
Had crossed an eagle with a horse. 
It carries knights in armor 
Through cloud fields at terrific speed. 
I wish the Hippogriff 
Would take me for a ride. Of course 
It's not real. 
                     But oh, if . . .!
