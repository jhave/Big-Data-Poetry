The Deer and the Snake
****!****

The deer is humble, lovely as God made her   
I watch her eyes and think of wonder owned 

These strange priests enter the cathedral of woods   
And seven Marys clean their hands to woo her 

Foot lifted, dagger-sharp--her ears   
Poised to their points like a leaf's head 

But the snake strikes, in a velvet arc 
Of murderous speed--assassin beautiful 

As mountain water at which a fawn drank   
Stand there, forever, while poison works 
 
While I stand counting the arms of your Cross   
Thinking that many Christs could hang there, crying.
