from Light: Men’s Voices
****!****

Men's voices in the dark
--once in a temple--
men's voices in the sun
--once I was caryatid
number nine--
men's voices in the park
--I was a statue
untouchable naked
with no other mirror
than the fingers of the air
yielding to thought after thought
with no other sadness
than the rustling of leaves--
men's voices in the park:
why did they waken me?
