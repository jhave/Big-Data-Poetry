****!****

a woman moves through dog rose and juniper bushes,
a pussy clean and folded between her legs,
breasts like the tips of her festive shoes
shine silently in her heavy armoire.

one blackbird, one cow, one horse.
the sea beats against the wall of the waterless. 
she walks to a phone booth that waits
a fair distance from all three villages.

it's a game she could have heard on the radio:
a question, a number, an answer, a prize.
her pussy reaches up and turns on the light in her womb.  

from the rain, she says into the receiver,
we compiled white tables and chairs under a shed 
into a crossword puzzle
and sat ourselves in the grid.

the receiver is silent. the bird flounces 
like a burglar caught red-handed. 
her voice stumbles over her glands. 
the body to be written in the last block--
i can suck his name out of any letter.

all three villages cover their faces with wind.
