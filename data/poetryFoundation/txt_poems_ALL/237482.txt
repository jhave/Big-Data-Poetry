Malachi  Black

Insomnia & So On
****!****

Fat bed, lick the black cat in my mouth 
each morning. Unfasten all the bones 

that make a head, and let me rest: unknown 
among the oboe-throated geese gone south 

to drop their down and sleep beside the out- 
bound tides. Now there's no nighttime I can own 

that isn't anxious as a phone 
about to ring. Give me some doubt 

on loan; give me a way to get away 
from what I know. I pace until the sun 

is in my window. I lie down. I'm a coal: 
I smolder to a bloodshot glow. Each day 

I die down in my bed of snow, undone 
by my red mind and what it woke.
