Fish of the Flood
****!****

Fish of the flood, on the bankèd billow
               Thou layest thy head in dreams;
Sliding as slides thy shifting pillow,
               One with the streams
                              Of the sea is thy spirit.

Gean-tree, thou spreadest thy foaming flourish
               Abroad in the sky so grey;
It not heeding if it thee nourish,
               Thou dost obey,
                              Happy, its moving.


So, God, thy love it not needeth me,
Only thy life, that I blessèd be.
