Keys to the City
****!****

Didn't rain choke the animal throats
of the cathedral      sputter
against the roofs of the city      didn't the flight
of stairs rise up above the cobbled street
didn't the key clamor
in the lock      flood
the vestibule with clattering    didn't we climb
the second flight
toward the miniature Allegory
painted on the ceiling
and touch the flat-faced girls
winged      part animal
who did not flinch and did not scamper
