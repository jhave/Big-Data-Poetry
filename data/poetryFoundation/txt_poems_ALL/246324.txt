Eliza   Griswold
****!****
Lisbon
****!****

We meet midway to walk white cobbles 
under a fish-flesh gray sky. 
Europe is collapsing; we are collapsing

always and again no matter how hard
we love one another. I don't understand 
our failure, where the feed loops 

back and spits us into another country, 
another junior suite reenacting this same,
same beat of   a scene that begins, rises,

never ends, always ends --
Our intentions don't meet, 
their courses set differently 

by a force you don't believe in,
could be as simple as life. I want 
to be the wife you don't want. 

You won't let go of my wrist. 
I resist, threaten, bully, acquiesce. 
We write the next act of The Alchemist

in New York, Lisbon, a beach, 
a bar, star-crossed maybe 
from different galaxies. You approach, 

I retreat. You retreat, I reproach.
The manic two-step jitters 
over North Africa's dunes 

farther than our hero, Santiago, can see. 
I rise in the night to find the sharp knife
that came with the pears as a courtesy.
