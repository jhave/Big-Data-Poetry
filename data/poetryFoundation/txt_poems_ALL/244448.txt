Having to make eye contact 
               with the economy--

A ball cap that says 
               In Dog Years I'm Dead--"The moon 

will turn blood red and then 
               disappear for awhile,” the TV enthused. Hunched

over an anatomy textbook, a student
               traces a heart 

               over another heart--lunar eclipse.

In the bathroom, crayoned 
               graffiti: 
                              fuck the ♥

 He collected CAPTCHA, one seat over, 
               Mr. feverish Mange Denied: 

like puzzling sabbath or 
               street pupas; we shared 

some recent typos: I'm 
               mediated (his), my tiny bots 

of stimulation, he
               loved the smudged 

and swoony words that proved him
               human-- 

not a machine trying to infiltrate
               the servers 

of the New York Times, from which he launched 
               (gad shakes or hefty lama) 

obits and exposés, some recipes, a digital pic of someone else's 
               black disaster, he 

lobbed links at both of his fathers (step and bio)
               a few former lovers, a high school coach, a college chum,
                           some people 

"from where I used to work,” so much info 
               (we both agreed), "The umbra,” 

the TV explained, shadow
               the earth was about to make--

      ...and if during the parenthesis they felt a strange uneasiness...

      ...firing rifles and clanging copper pots to rescue the threatened...

      ...so benighted and hopelessly lost...

      ...their eyes to the errors...


MOON LORE, Farmer's Almanac. Waiting room, 
               hour two.

Urgent Care. That was pretty
               multivalent. As in: 

               We really need you to take care of this. 
               We really need you 

               to care for this. 
               To care about this. We really need you 

to peer through the clinic's 
               storefront window, on alert 

               for the ballyhooed moon--

And there it was. Reddening 

in its black sock, deep 
               in the middle of the hour, of someone's

               nutso-tinsel talk on splendor--

My fevered friend. Describing

the knocked-out flesh. Each of our heads 
               fitting like a flash drive 

               into the port of a healer's hands.
