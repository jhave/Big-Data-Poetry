Soft
****!****

In harmony with the rule of irony-- 
which requires that we harbor the enemy   
on this side of the barricade--the shell 
of the unborn eagle or pelican, which is made 
to give protection till the great beaks can harden,   
is the first thing to take up poison.   
The mineral case is soft and gibbous   
as the moon in a lake--an elastic,   
rubbery, nightmare water that won't break.   
Elsewhere, also, I see the mockeries of struggle,   
a softness over people.
