The Vanity of the Dragonfly
****!****

The dragonfly at rest on the doorbell-- 
too weak to ring and glad of it, 
but well mannered and cautious, 
thinking it best to observe us quietly 
before flying in, and who knows if he will find 
the way out? Cautious of traps, this one.
A winged cross, plain, the body straight 
as a thermometer, the old glass kind 
that could kill us with mercury if our teeth 
did not respect its brittle body. Slim as an eel 
but a solitary glider, a pilot without bombs 
or weapons, and wings clear and small as a wish
to see over our heads, to see the whole picture. 
And when our gaze grazes over it and moves on, 
the dragonfly changes its clothes,
sheds its old skin, shriveled like laundry, 
and steps forth, polished black, with two 
circles buttoned like epaulettes taking the last space 
at the edge of its eyes.
