A Charm

I have a twin who bears my name;   
Bears it about with him in shame; 

Who goes a way I would not go; 
Has knowledge of things I would not know; 

When I was brave he was afraid;   
He told the truth, I lied; 

What's sweet to me tastes bitter to him; 
My friends, my friends, he doesn't love them; 

I walk the daylight in his dream; 
He breathes the air of my nightmare.
