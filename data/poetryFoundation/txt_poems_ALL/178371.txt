Happy as a Dog’s Tail
****!****

Happy as something unimportant   
and free as a thing unimportant.   
As something no one prizes 
and which does not prize itself.   
As something mocked by all 
and which mocks at their mockery.   
As laughter without serious reason.   
As a yell able to outyell itself.   
Happy as no matter what, 
as any no matter what. 

Happy 
as a dog's tail.
