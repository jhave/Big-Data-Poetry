Speak to Us
****!****

For all of my years, I've read only living signs--
bodies in jealousy, bodies in battle, 
bodies growing disease like mushroom coral.
It is tiresome, tiresome, describing 
fir cones waiting for fires to catch their human ribs 
into some slow, future forest.

My beloved, he tires of me, and he should--
my complaints the same, his recourse 
the same, invoking the broad, cool sheet suffering drapes
over the living freeze of heart after heart, 
and never by that heart's fault--the heart did not make itself,
the face did not fashion its jutting jawbone 
to wail across the plains or beg the bare city. 

I will no longer tally the broken, ospreyed oceans, 
the figs that outlived summer 
or the tedious mineral angles and 
their suction of light. 

Have you died? Then speak. 
You must see the living 
are too small as they are, 
lonesome for more 
and in varieties of pain 
only you can bring into right view.
