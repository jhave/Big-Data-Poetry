I, Too
****!****

I, too, sing America. 

I am the darker brother. 
They send me to eat in the kitchen 
When company comes, 
But I laugh, 
And eat well, 
And grow strong. 

Tomorrow, 
I'll be at the table 
When company comes. 
Nobody'll dare 
Say to me, 
"Eat in the kitchen,” 
Then. 

Besides, 
They'll see how beautiful I am 
And be ashamed-- 

I, too, am America.
