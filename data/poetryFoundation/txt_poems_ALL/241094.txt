Au silence de celle qui laisse rêveur. --René Char
By boat to Seurasaari where 
the small fish were called vendace.  
A man blew a horn of birchwood 
toward the nightless sea.

Still voice. Fire that is no fire. 
Ahead years unknown to be lived--



Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then 
one by one, hours. Outside 
(so fleetingly) ourselves--

In a still mirror, in a blue within 
where this earthly journey dreaming
itself begins,

thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.



Mountains before and behind, 
heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,
then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.

Spent fuel, burnt
wind, mute swans.



 We drove the birch-lined 
highway from Dresden 
to Berlin behind armored 
cars in late afternoon, 
nineteenth of June, passing 
the black cloud of a freight 
truck from Budapest.

Through disappearing
villages, past horses grazing vanished fields.




The year before you died, America 
went to war again on the other 
side of the world.
This is how the earth becomes, 
you said, a grotto of skeletons.




 In the ruins of a station: a soaked 
bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.

White weather, chalk and basalt, 
puffins, fuchsia and history shot 
through with particles 
of recognition: this one 
wetted down with petrol then 
set alight, that one taking 
forty rounds, this other 
found eleven years later in a bog.

In the station house, imaginary 
maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry 
of arrivals, the logs of ghost 
ships and a few prison 
diaries written on tissue paper.




Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies?   
The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze?  

Through the casements of glass hand-blown 
before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop 
through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigs
in wind through glass.

Who were we then? Such 
a laughter as morning peeled 
its light from us!   




You said the cemeteries were full in a voice 
like wind plaiting willows--fields in bloom 
but silent without grasshoppers or bees.  
What do you want then? You with your 

neverness, your unknown, 
your book of things, you
with once years ahead to be lived.




Your father believes he took you 
with him, that you are
in an urn beside your sleeping mother
but I am still writing with your hand,
as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.




Such is the piano's sadness and the rifle's moonlight.  
Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not--

do not, upon waking, gaze out a window 
if you wish to remember your dream




An ache of hope that you will come back--
the cawing flock is not your coming.

Did you float toward Salzburg? A wind
in the mustard fields?--or walk instead 
beside me through the asylum in Krakow?   
Hours after your death you seemed 
everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight.  
Now your moments are clouds
in a photograph of swifts. 




In the hour held 
open between day and night under 
the meteor showers of Perseid
we held each other for the last time.

Dead, you whispered where is the road?  

There, through the last of the sentences, just there--
through the last of the sentences, the road--
