Bone and Hue

There was a young woman 
who lived in her shoes.

Bare-backed, she sat 
with elders and sheened 
her nails with sloe. 

Felt purse, trunk, 
berries in bottled gin.

Smoke rose 
from the purples of the ground. 

Moscow maybe next, or 
Poland, where the numbers burned.

Purples of the mosses turned.
Some million shades.
Six million more.

Purples of the mosses,
and all the millions, blue.

She had so many lives,
she didn't know what to do.
