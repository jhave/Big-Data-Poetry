Green Tea
****!****

There is this tea 
I have sometimes, 
Pan Long Ying Hao, 
so tightly curled 
it looks like tiny roots 
gnarled, a greenish-gray. 
When it steeps, it opens 
the way you woke this morning, 
stretching, your hands behind 
your head, back arched, 
toes pointing, a smile steeped 
in ceremony, a celebration, 
the reaching of your arms.
