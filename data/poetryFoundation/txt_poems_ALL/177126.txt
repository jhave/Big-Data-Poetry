Surfaces
****!****

Surfaces serve 
their own purposes, 
strive to remain 
constant (all lives 
want that). There is   
a skin, not just on   
peaches but on oceans 
(note the telltale 
slough of foam on beaches). 
Sometimes it's loose, 
as in the case 
of cats: you feel how a   
second life slides 
under it. Sometimes it 
fits. Take glass. 
Sometimes it outlasts 
its underside. Take reefs. 

The private lives of surfaces 
are innocent, not devious. 
Take the one-dimensional 
belief of enamel in itself, 
the furious autonomy 
of luster (crush a pearl-- 
it's powder), the whole 
curious seamlessness 
of how we're each surrounded 
and what it doesn't teach.
