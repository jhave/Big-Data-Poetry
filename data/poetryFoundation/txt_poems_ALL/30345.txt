Implements from the “Tomb of the Poet”

Piraeus Archeological Museum
On the journey to the mundane afterlife, 
You travel equipped to carry on your trade: 
A bronze, small-toothed saw to make repairs, 
The stylus and the ink pot and the scraper, 
Wax tablets bound into a little book. 

Here is the tortoise shell for the cithara, 
Bored through with holes for strings, natural sound box. 
Here is the harp's wood triangle, all empty--
The sheep-gut having long since decomposed 
Into a pure Pythagorean music. 

The beeswax, frangible with centuries, 
Has puzzled all your lyrics into silence. 
I think you were a poet of perfection 
Who fled still weighing one word with another, 
Since wax forgives and warms beneath revision.
