Danger of Falling
****!****

The way calcium grows 

all by itself into bone, microscopic 
fraction attaches itself to fraction 

or clouds crystallize, or blizzards congeal into hard 
ice on aluminum wings, 

even the astronauts' bodysuits can't cover up 
the sheer strangeness of it, the extraordinary being-here 

or anywhere, the skin of the plane could easily peel back 
like an ear of corn and then what's to be seen but who, me? 

the live, disintegrating, 
terrified Barbie Doll asks, stuffed into her jeans 

like a stick of butter, her neat, pointed feet dangerously 
stuck into sky... 

but still, teetering down the aisle 
if anyone bumps her she glares,  This Is My Territory, 

this little packet of a hundred and twenty-two 
pounds more or less says Move it, Babe, 

one minute the cold kitchen, next minute Miami Beach, 
digging into the sand beside the violent- 

ly green sea, droplets of Almighty coconut oil 
under the crisp tang of salt drizzle and lick 

all over its bare, lusciously bronzed congregation 
of too too solid-- 

No! Never in this world, the greedy molecules hiss 

as the plane turns inland, the woman returns to her seat 
past all the other anonymous collections of cells, 

some snoring, some fussing with their kids, 
one bent over a laptop, another staring 

straight at her for a second, with X-ray 
exhausted eyes peering, then swiveling away 

as if they'd known each other before, fellow crew members 
from another planet, 

though the woman thinks of herself only on Main Street--my 
my what an arrangement of chromosomes collected 

who knows why--up here among streaked, boiling clouds 
with the plane speeding through them, how 

unexpected it is, how far the body travels 
from its babyhood, locked in its charged circuits 

she thinks about edges, the leathery sunburned skin 
flaking off, in filmy shreds, 

sound barriers breaking away from her but here she still is 
for this one second fixed, eyes sticking out of the top of her face 

like the glint of a buried pin or the beak 
of a mother robin in the nest 

she made for herself: 

with earth losing its outer walls 
twig by twig, what is this naked fork quivering 

in the middle of Whose consciousness 

she keeps wondering, whizzing across the face 
of an electric cloud chamber, 

here all I am 
is falling, in the tight ship of the diminished, 

in hot chips of pure 
ignorant energy fizzing around some magnet, 

some lucky iron only 
imagination can count on, 

trembling, gritting her teeth on the thread 
of an end she can't know, 

Please, Someone, materialize me 
in arms I can love always 

she whispers to herself, 
Beam Me Up...
