               1 

Rain fell as a glass 
breaks,
something suddenly everywhere at the same time.


               2 

To live like a painting 
looked into from more than one angle at once --

eye to eye with the doorway,
down at the hair,
up at your own dusty feet. 


                3 

"This is your house,”
said my bird heart to my heart of the cricket, 
and I entered.


                4 

The happy see only happiness,
the living see only life,
the young see only the young,

as lovers believe
they wake always beside one also in love.


                5 

However often I turned its pages,
I kept ending up 
as the same two sentences of the book:

The being of some is: to be. Of others: to be without.

Then I fell back asleep, in Swedish.


                6 

A sheep grazing is unimpressed by the mountain
but not by its flies.


                7 

The grief
of what hasn't yet happened --

a door closed from inside.

The weight of the grass 
dividing
an ant's five-legged silence
walking through it.


                8 

What is the towel, what is the water, 
changes,
though of we three, 
only the towel can be held upside down in the sun.


                9 

"I was once.”
Said not in self-pity or praise.
This dignity we allow barn owl, 
ego, oyster.
