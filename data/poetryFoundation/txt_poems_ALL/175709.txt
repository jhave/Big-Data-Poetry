Portrait of a Figure near Water
****!****

Rebuked, she turned and ran 
uphill to the barn. Anger, the inner   
arsonist, held a match to her brain.   
She observed her life: against her will   
it survived the unwavering flame. 

The barn was empty of animals.   
Only a swallow tilted 
near the beams, and bats 
hung from the rafters 
the roof sagged between. 

Her breath became steady 
where, years past, the farmer cooled   
the big tin amphoræ of milk. 
The stone trough was still 
filled with water: she watched it   
and received its calm. 

So it is when we retreat in anger:   
we think we burn alone 
and there is no balm. 
Then water enters, though it makes   
no sound.
