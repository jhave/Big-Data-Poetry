I read that in this famous person's poems "she searches 
for signs of what lies beneath and beyond the self.” 
Which seemed to me pointless, as if you wouldn't know 

whether to paint with egg tempera or eat it. At eighteen, 
I came across Tolstoy's "What is Art?” where he said 
an artist is different from other people because instead 

of eating an apple he paints it. Even then I thought why 
can't he paint it and then eat it, the way at eight, the war 
just over, I stood shoeless in line in the snowy playground 

where one of the kids was handing out something that turned out 
to be small pieces of orange peel, something exotic we'd never 
seen before which I smelled, nibbled, and finally ate for this poem.
