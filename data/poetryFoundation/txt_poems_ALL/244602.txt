The Stags
****!****

This is the multitude, the beasts 
you wanted to show me, drawing me 
upstream, all morning up through wind-
scoured heather to the hillcrest. 
Below us, in the next glen, is the grave 
calm brotherhood, descended 
out of winter, out of hunger, kneeling 
like the signatories of a covenant; 
their weighty, antique-polished antlers 
rising above the vegetation 
like masts in a harbor, or city spires. 
We lie close together, and though the wind
whips away our man-and-woman smell, every
stag-face seems to look toward us, toward, 
but not to us: we're held, and hold them, 
in civil regard. I suspect you'd 
hoped to impress me, to lift to my sight 
our shared country, lead me deeper 
into what you know, but loath
to cause fear you're already moving 
quietly away, sure I'll go with you, 
as I would now, almost anywhere.
