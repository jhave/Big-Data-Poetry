Confession
****!****

I have a brief confession
that I would like to make.
If I dont get it off my chest
I'm sure my heart will break.

I didn't do my reading.
I watched TV instead--
while munching cookies, cakes, and chips
and cinnamon raisin bread.

I didn't wash the dishes.
I didn't clean the mess.
Now there are roaches eating crumbs--
a million, more or less.

I didn't turn the TV off.
I didn't shut the light.
Just think of all the energy
I wasted through the night.

I feel so very guilty.
I did a lousy job.
I hope my students don't find out
that I am such a slob.
