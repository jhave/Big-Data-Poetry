What the Dove Sings
****!****

The mourning dove
wearing noon's aureole
coos from the rhododendron,
oo-waoh, shadow o- 
ver what to do. Oh.
And the sad rhetoric spreads
through suburb and wood.
Those who hear 
dove moan love no 
querulous warbling more--
the going hence 
about which is there no- 
thing to do? 
From no small rip in fate
the you you never shall be
more will be extracted.
Dove knows the rubric
and starts in, who, 
who is next and soon?
