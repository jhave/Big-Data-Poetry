from Deaf Republic: 9
****!****

I am not a poet, Sonya I inspect
the fragrant feet of younger ladies--
 
While deafness hums as a little motor
I watch her stand in the shower
 
holding her breasts 
in her hands like two small explosions.
 
I am her boy drowning. 
In this country he does not know
 
the word for "drowning” and yells:
"I am diving for the last time!”
