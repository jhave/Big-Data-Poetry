Closing Hours
****!****

This trace, if it exists, is alms for delusion.   
An arch uncurls from the floor 
scented with the scent of a tapestry, housed here.   
I recall the hour but not its passage 
unless dream captures and ties it to sleep: 
a fat bellhop smiles, shows me to the tower   
where I can watch the departure. 
But some days settle so that nothing 
crosses the horizon; stare as I will, no star   
needles the air. Now I am left 
on the outskirts of a forest hemmed in by wheat   
where plump trees hide the image, its symmetry   
shot up and blown across the ground like feathers.   
The unicorn, the grail, blue and red wings   
of kneeling musicians, these are embroidered   
elsewhere. Perseverance was crowned. 
Hope and Pity prayed for success. 
How fast is this camera? Can it record a trace?   
There was a voyage. Four mounted horses   
strain against centuries. 
To each is allotted: dust kicked up, smoke, plumage.
