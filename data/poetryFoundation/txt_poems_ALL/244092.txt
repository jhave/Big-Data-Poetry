Early Elegy: Smallpox
****!****

The world has certified itself rid of 
all but the argument: to eradicate or not 
the small stock of variola frozen, 
quarantined--a dormancy it has 
refused, just once, for a woman behind a sterile 
lens, her glass slide a clearest, most 
becoming pane. How could it resist slipping 
away with her, that discrete first pock?
