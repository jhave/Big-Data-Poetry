The Gospel of Ometéotl, the Brown Adam
****!****

People walk through you, the wind steals your voice,  you're a burra, buey, scapegoat,forerunner of a new race,half and half -- both woman and man, neither -- a new gender.                          --Gloria Anzaldúa
Jasmine garlands thin
             for the rib's cartilage ring.

The heart shudders with pure mission.

                                                         She spreads
                                                          & knows herself as Adam,
                                                          Ometéotl,

                                                          but through himself,
                                                          Omecíhuatl,

                                                          he is Eve.

             He knows but what the garden gives:

                        the garden's soot
                         awakened tongueless in root.

             Cerise chrysantha
                         coils around his leg.

             Gathering the tides
                                     of the seas to his side,
                                     she conceives

                                     where impossibilities seed.

            Clarity burning coal,                he takes two knots

                                                of grass
                                                & strings

                        four birds-of-paradise

            through the ceiba's rotted leaves:

                                    she fashions the sorrows
                                     from winter's purse,

                                     sea
                                     & sun

                                     sifted for sum.

                         Entrammeled, Ometéotl rises
                                     one among one

                         body stitched in strange altar.
