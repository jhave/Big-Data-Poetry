Ira Will Not Be Attending the Meeting
****!****

When working on a small scale
He is practicing a gesture.
So much of life is practicing gestures.
So much of living is evaluating
Those around you for signs of damage.

Now it is night, morning's a blink away.
Sleep is sometimes thought of
As an avalanche of repair gnomes
That attends your pit stop.
Would that we were sleeping now!

Viable alternatives will be reviled
Until the point of no return is passed.
The only reasonable course of action
Is to look for sizeable flotsam,
Redo the resume, learn a martial art.
