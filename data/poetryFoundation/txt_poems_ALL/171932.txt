Half an Hour
****!****

Hurt, hurtful, snake-charmed, 
struck white together half an hour we tear   
through the half-dark after 

some sweet core,   
under, over gravity,   
some white shore ... 

spin, hidden one, spin, 
trusted to me! laugh sore tooth   
sucked warm, sweet; sweet wine 

running cool through new 
dry shrewd turnings of my soul,   
opening veins. 

Gull-feathers beating,   
beating! Gliding. Still,   
sidelong eye ... wings beating 

like words against my eyes.   
And your eyes-- 
o brother-animal, mild, 

terrible!--your eyes wait, have been waiting,   
knowing, 
unknowable, on that sky shore. 

A life is waiting.   
Its webbed hand   
reached out ... 

Trust me! 
truth- 
telling fish of the sky! 

your hand beyond my hand,   
your phosphorous trail   
broken, lost.
