Jim Gott and old money don't mix. There is 
no possibility of change. He sent flowers 
to the old lady, to no avail. Then he fought 
the Chinese laundry over the disputed crease 
in his last clean shirt sent by ups; the Chinaman 
got a court order that he not be so called.
He makes peanuts: Jim's thousand a year is viewed 
as a decent living: you figure it out. 

Old Gott was taken to court, a kind of 
maze synod, that September, ornamental 
cherry petals littering the streets.
Thirty-eight years later the charge sheet tells us 
that he was called The Fiendish. In the distant 
future, I shall be as efficient as you.
