Instructions for Building Straw Huts
****!****

First you must have 
unbelievable faith in water, 
in women dancing like hands playing harps 
for straw to grow stalks of fire. 
You must understand the year 
that begins with your hands tied 
behind your back, 
worship of dark totems 
weighed down with night birds that shift their weight 
& leave holes in the sky. You must know 
what's behind the shadow of a treadmill-- 
its window the moon's reflection 
& silent season reaching 
into red sunlight hills. 
You must know the hard science 
of building walls that sway with summer storms. 
Locking arms to a frame of air, frame of oak 
rooted to ancient ground 
where the door's constructed last, 
just wide enough for two lovers 
to enter on hands & knees. 
You must dance 
the weaverbird's song 
for mending water & light 
with straw, earth, mind, bright loom of grain 
untortured by bushels of thorns.
