Girl-Watching
****!****

In the years I've been at this
(Lots, not to be precise)
You'd think that once or twice
At least I would have seen
Some anomalies. I mean
Some major ones. As in
Not feet but little wheels,
Or crests like cockatiels'.
Where are they keeping the girls
With a chrome exterior,
Or an extra derriere?
Apparently nowhere.
Assuming my sample's valid,
The pool is limited 
To the standard types I've tallied;
Such variance as there is
In the usual congeries
Of   physiognomies --
And yet enough of   it 
To be worth the looking at. 
The walking by, for that,
Of   the same girl over and over
Would be no cross to bear
If   it were that one there.
