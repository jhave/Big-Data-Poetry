Elms
****!****

All day I tried to distinguish 
need from desire. Now, in the dark, 
I feel only bitter sadness for us, 
the builders, the planers of wood, 
because I have been looking 
steadily at these elms 
and seen the process that creates 
the writhing, stationary tree 
is torment, and have understood 
it will make no forms but twisted forms.
