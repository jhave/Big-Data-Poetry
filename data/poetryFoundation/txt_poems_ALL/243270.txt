New Year
****!****

Last night something
             tunneled through the elms.
  
 But at sunrise,
             I found just white light
  
 biting my eyelids, salt
             rubbed on a wound.
  
 Batons of ice
             fell from power lines,
             
 soundless but still emphatic.
             Then the rain
  
 churned the snow to soap
             scum, waxing cars with
  
 winter's lichen, patchy
             in the strange
  
 uneven fur of newborns.
             And still, I was childless.
  
 One cardinal
             lodged on a branch:
  
 a blood-drop
             striking water
  
 before the slow dispersion.
