Jamaal  May

Hum for the Bolt
****!****

It could of course be silk. Fifty yards or so
of the next closest thing to water to the touch,
or it could just as easily be a shaft of  wood 

crumpling a man struck between spaulder and helm. 
But now, with the rain making a noisy erasure 
of this town, it is the flash that arrives 

and leaves at nearly the same moment. It's what I want 
to be in this moment, in this doorway, 
because much as I'd love to be the silk-shimmer 

against the curve of anyone's arm, 
as brutal and impeccable as it'd be to soar 
from a crossbow with a whistle and have a man 

switch off upon my arrival, it is nothing 
compared to that moment when I eat the dark,
draw shadows in quick strokes across wall

and start a tongue counting 
down to thunder. That counting that says, 
I am this far. I am this close.
