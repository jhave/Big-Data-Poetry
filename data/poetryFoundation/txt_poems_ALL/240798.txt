I Did This to My Vocabulary
****!****

The moon is my alibi. My tenders throw hissy fits.
My scalp's at the foot of the precipice.
My lume is spento, there's a creep in my cellar.
You can stand under my umbrella, Ella.

Who put pubic hair on my headphones?
Who put the ram in Ramallah?
I'm just sitting here spinning my spinning wheels--
where are the snow tires of tomorrow?

The llama is burning! My heart is an ovary!
Let's chase dawn's tail across state lines,
sing "Crimson and Clover” over and overy,
till wonders are taken for road signs.

My fish, fast and loose, shoot fish in a kettle.
The boys like the girls who like heavy metal.
On Sabbath, on Slayer, on Maiden and Venom, 
on Motörhead, Leppard, and Zeppelin, and Mayhem . . .
