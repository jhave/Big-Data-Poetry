Where i-95 meets the Pike, 
a ponderous thunderhead flowered;

stewed a minute, then flipped
like a flash card, tattered
edges crinkling in, linings so dark 
with excessive bright

that, standing, waiting, at the overpass edge, 
the onlooker couldn't decide

until the end, or even then,
what was revealed and what had been hidden.
