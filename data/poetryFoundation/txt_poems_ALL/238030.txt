Dress Rehearsal
****!****

Branches etch the film of ice
on the studio window. A crow looks in,
hopping and shrieking when I dance
in my black tutu, trimmed with silver. 

The ballet master says, you are its mother.
But in a crow's sky-knowing mind
could I be so misconstrued? 
Out of the blackest

cold-wet air, the crow seems molded. 
The stars will not wake up to guide it 
back to the creek of shadows
where it was formed. Practice, practice. 

I am smoke in darkness, climbing away
from a burning hut, in an otherwise empty field
on which the fire is slight and low, 
and the rest of it is snow.
