Jook Joint Saturday Night
****!****

Jook joint's about to come alive!
It's like a bee outside a hive;
And when the hive begins to hum,
It's like a dim and distant drum;
And when the drum begins to beat,
It's like a circus down the street;
And when the street begins to fill,
It's like a sudden summer chill;
And just as summer simmers down,
It's like the fireworks over town.
Don't matter what the preachers say--
This congregation's here to stay
'Cause when the jook joint comes alive
Is when the Delta blues arrive!
