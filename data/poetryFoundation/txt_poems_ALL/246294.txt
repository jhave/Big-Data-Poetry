Nocturne
****!****

Where are you now,
my poems, 
my sleepwalkers?
No mumbles tonight?
Where are you, thirst,
fever, humming tedium?
The sodium streetlights 
burr outside my window, 
steadfast, unreachable, 
little astonishments 
lighting the way uphill.
Where are you now,
when I need you most?
             It's late. I'm old. 
                         Come soon, you feral cats 
                                      among the dahlias.
