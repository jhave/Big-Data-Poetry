The pathways of my thoughts are cobbled with 
        mesquite blocks
                and narrow-winding, 
        long and aged like the streets of 
                san fernando de bexar
                        y la villa real de san antonio

        pensive
                y callados 
        cada uno con su chiste
                idiosyncracy
                        crazy turns 
        that are because they are,
                centuries magic

cada uno hecho así,
        y with a careful 
                capricho touch, 
                        así.

They curl slowly into ripples,
        earthy and cool like the Río Medina 
                under the trees
                        silently singing, standing still, 
                and flowing, becoming, 
        became 
and always as always
        still fertile, laughing, loving, 
                alivianada
                        Río Medina
                                under the trees, 
                                        celebrating life.

They end up in the monte, chaparral, 
        llenos de burrs, spurs 
                pero libres 
Running through the hills freefoot 
       con aire azul 
               blue breaths peacefully taken 
                       between each lope 
                               remembering venado 
                                       remembering conejos 
                                               remembering 
                                                       where 
                                                               we came from
