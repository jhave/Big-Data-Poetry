Rings possess fingers.

Fingers remember
what the eyes have

blocked. The blindness
in this

case is figurative.
The figure in this

case is
curvaceous.

)


Milled, folded,
soldered.

Inlaid omen.
Mokume gane.

Ifs as hinges.
Ands as pins.

Rings as
reunions.

In some remote
pre-dawn eye slit

                           the horizon largely
             the same

the cinquefoils still
chirpy and obliging the ox-eyed

             daisies and the daisies
                           fleabane and the worts and weeds

             the thistles and yarrows
still healing and exotic
                           in their ways--

Weeds bind.
             Tongues beard.
                           Thimbles berry.
             Balms bee.

Flags blue.

Rain clarifies colors--

                           colors reveal the brief
ambition of these
                           provincial weeds.
                           In gullies,

             mosses soft, mosses bright

as dyed suede
feel rich beneath scrubbed feet.

             Rain--nature's iteration--

                           light paradiddles
                                       on the surface

                                                      of the creek.

How free-making this word
                                                      (penniless)

before
a judge!
