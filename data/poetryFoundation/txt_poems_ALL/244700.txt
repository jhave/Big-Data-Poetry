The Visitor
****!****

Does no dishes, dribbles sauce 
across the floor. Is more dragon 
than spaniel, more flammable 
than fluid. Is the loosening 
in the knit of me, the mixed-fruit 
marmalade in the kitchen of me. 
Wakes my disco and inner hibiscus, 
the Hector in the ever-mess of my Troy. 
All wet mattress to my analysis,
he's stayed the loudest and longest
of any houseguest, is calling now 
as I write this, tiny B who brings the joy.
