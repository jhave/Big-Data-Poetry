Loop
****!****

Curled up in bed,
 I'm young
 in the old way.
  
                •
  
 One
 continuous stroke

 without lifting
 the pen

 as if

"stem, tendril,
 stem tendril”

 were the words
 of a commandment.
  
                •
  
 My next
 elliptical loops

 read "Praise.”

 Word

 deciphered

 at a snail's
 pace.
