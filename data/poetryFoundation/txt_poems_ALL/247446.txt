Lives of the Poets
****!****

One stood among the violets
listening to a bird. One went to the toilet
and was struck by the moon. One felt hopeless
until a trumpet crash, and then lo,
he became a diamond. I have a shovel.
Can I turn it into a poem? On my stove
I'm boiling some milk thistle.
I hope it will turn into a winged thesis 
before you stop reading. Look, I'm topless!
Listen: approaching hooves!
One drowned in a swimming pool.
One removed his shoes
and yearned off a bridge. One lives
with Alzheimer's in a state facility, spittle
in his white beard. It
turns out words are no help.
But here I am with my shovel
digging like a fool
beside the spilth and splosh
of the ungirdled sea. I can't stop.
The horses are coming, the thieves.
I still haven't found lasting love.
I still want to hear viols
in the little beach hotel
that's torn down and gone.
I want to see again the fish
schooling and glittering like a veil
where the waves shove
against the breakwater. Gone
is the girl in her white slip
testing the chill with one bare foot.
It's too cold, but she goes in, so
carefully, oh.
