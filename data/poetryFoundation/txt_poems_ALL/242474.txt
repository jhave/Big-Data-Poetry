The Flurry
****!****

When we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
I mutter, "I feel like a killer.” "I'm
the killer”--taking my wrist--he says,
holding it. He is sitting on the couch, 
the old indigo chintz around him, 
rich as a night sea with jellies, 
I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust I carry around me. Tonight,
to breathe its Magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where I was born--fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens--and I'm
sharing the glass with him. "Don't catch
my cold,” he says, "--oh that's right, you want
to catch my cold.” I should not have told him that,
I tell him I will try to fall out of 
love with him, but I feel I will love him
all my life. He says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, I imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it--a heart's spurt 
of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nod
to it, it is my hope.
