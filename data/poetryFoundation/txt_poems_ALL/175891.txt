Song of the Powers
****!****

Mine, said the stone, 
mine is the hour. 
I crush the scissors, 
such is my power. 
Stronger than wishes, 
my power, alone. 

Mine, said the paper, 
mine are the words 
that smother the stone 
with imagined birds, 
reams of them, flown 
from the mind of the shaper. 

Mine, said the scissors, 
mine all the knives 
gashing through paper's 
ethereal lives; 
nothing's so proper 
as tattering wishes. 

As stone crushes scissors, 
as paper snuffs stone 
and scissors cut paper, 
all end alone. 
So heap up your paper 
and scissor your wishes 
and uproot the stone 
from the top of the hill. 
They all end alone 
as you will, you will.
