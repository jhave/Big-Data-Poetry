Amidwives: Two Portraits
****!****

i. a wife will wean
 

by coming between

her husband 
and the woman who

whelped him. And 
should he bemoan

the sweet taste gone, 
she'll boast of how she

helped him--helped 
him get beyond

his milks at last, and cut 
from gums beneath

--the better to shake
her memory with--

permanent teeth.


ii. a mother will woo

 
a married man who 

was once her darling 
son. She can't conceive

of anyone loving him
through and through

as she has done. She'll 
do whatever it takes

to test his trust. She'll 
run a tempered blade

into the marriage 
bed and find the naked 

place where she was 
most betrayed

--and thrust.
