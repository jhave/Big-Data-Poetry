Folk Tale

1. 

All knobs and knuckles, hammer knees and elbows   
they were a multitude of two, man and woman   
dwelling as one tight flesh. In hallways,   
on stairs vaguely lit by twilight, in their own   
meager bed they would collide. . . veer off. . . 
collide, like aging children aiming those   
bumper cars, madly in Kansas Coney Islands. 
Blue sparks jumped on their ceiling, lit her stockings   
strangling his faucet, his fist plumbing 
her shoulder's depth for blood. Until, as it is told, 
they brought the cow into the house, straight from the barn,   
oppressed for years with milk. They tied it,   
lowing, to the icebox, pastured it 
on rubber plants and dusty philodendrons. 
They brought the horse in next, leaving the plow   
like an abandoned aircraft, nose down 
in rusting fields of corn. The pig, the donkey,   
the rooster with its crowd of hens, they even 
brought a neighbor's child complete with spelling words   
and scales that wandered up and down the untuned   
piano searching for roost as the chickens   
searched and the cow, nuzzling the humming   
frigidaire as if it were a calf.

So they survived with all that cuckoo's brood,   
hearing the horse stamp through the floorboards, 
the donkey chew the welcome mat, and all night long   
through tumbling barricades of sleep the yeasty   
rise and fall of breath. By blue television light   
they milked and gathered, boiled the placid eggs   
that turned up everywhere, laughed with the child,   
fed the pig, and glimpsed each other's rounded limbs 
reflected for a moment in the copper 
washtub or around the feathers of a settling hen.   
And winter passed; and spring; and summer, 
The child left first, all braided, for the school bus.   
The cow died of old griefs. The horse dreaming   
of harness, the pig of swill, the donkey 
of what magnitude of straw, broke out one night   
and emptied the ark. Man and woman leaning   
on brooms stood at the kitchen door and waved,   
saw through a blaze of autumn the cock's comb   
like one last, bright leaf flutter and disappear.   
Then jostling a bit, for ceremony's sake, 
they turned and lost themselves in so much space.
