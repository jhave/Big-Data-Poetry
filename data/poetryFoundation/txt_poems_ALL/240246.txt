Walking, Blues
****!****

Rain so dark I
can't get through--
train going by 

in a hurry. The voice
said walk or die, I
walked,--the train

and the voice all 
blurry. I walked with 
my bones and my heart

of chalk, not even
a splintered notion:
days of thought, nights

of worry,--lonesome 
train in a hurry.
