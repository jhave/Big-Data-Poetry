Whether
****!****

Whether anger quickens a lagging stride, 
and periodic burn-offs in the forest
revitalize exhausted soil and flora--.
Whether we should take pleasure in the wildcat

jubilation of a lightning bolt
that whips its silver vein of genesis
through the night sky, flash-photo of a white 
birch upended, the root-system buckled

to swollen thunderheads--. And whether naming 
an offense amounts to sour grapes and common 
bitterness, or even the conceited nonsense 
of unwashed yahoo multitudes, a yawping

insult to civilized behavior--. Whether 
a July rainstorm, even when it drenches 
the unprepared pedestrian and befuddles 
traffic, might be extravagant, a joy,

like the whoops and escalating bop glissandos 
of Gillespie's upraised horn, cascading pitches 
a countersong to meteoric chalk marks 
Perseids burn across the House of Leo--.

And whether peaceful ecstasy might float 
up from a fifteen-second avalanche 
reflected in the skier's goggles, his jacket 
a spark of scarlet on the topmost slope,

waiting for the homeward track to clear.
