Hair rush, low swoop-- 
so those of us

stuck here on earth 
know--you must be gods.

Or friends of gods, 
granted chances

to push off into sky, 
granted chances

to hear so well 
your own voice bounced

back to you 
maps the night.

Each hinge 
in your wing's

an act of creation. 
Each insect

you snick out of air 
a witness.

You transform 
obstacles

into sounds, 
then dodge them.
