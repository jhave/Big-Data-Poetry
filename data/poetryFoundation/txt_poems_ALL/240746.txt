"and then looks at
 the stars” from the 
 bed in the ambulance
  
 looks up at boughs of
 trees shifting quickly
 lit in blackness
  
 blackening soft, deep
 siren's song--she died
 several times that night
  
 and only in the weeks
 to come started and
 started to come back
  
 then forward which is
 real life
