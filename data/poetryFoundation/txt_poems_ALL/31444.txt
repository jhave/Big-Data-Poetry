Lady MacBeth's Confession
****!****

Never mind thick night! Darkness move quick!   
Madness engulf me like Jacob's coat;   
colors tighten like sickness 'round me throat.   
Wha it is do already can't tek back   
but it still got me a wash me hand   
til they sour and callus, de visions   
plaguing de dark a me mind like locust.   

Me conscience no business dem days   
when me could grin up and skin teet 1    
inna company of great men   
who smile up smile up wid me   
an looking fava 2  inna secret eyes an backdoor smiles.   
I know say woman like me plain wicked an conniving:   
stinkin' wid ambition, smilin' close against you skin,   
seeking confession wid de devil.   

Now so, me lay up inna bed wid death   
a-write me love letter. Got me   
a crave colors to soothe me spirit;   
red never could please me,   
purple grind like a grater on me cheek,   
orange sting like a ledda on me hot skin,   
and white--mek me breast feel weight down   
wid milk, got me head swirling like inna hurricane.   
I chew down me bitter nails til I taste de poison

1 be insincere; 2 special treatment
