Realism
****!****

The smashed weirdness of the raving cadenzas of God 
Takes over all of a sudden
In our time. It speaks through the voices of talk show moderators.

It tells us in a ringing anthem, like heavenly hosts uplifted, 
That the rhapsody of the pastoral is out to lunch. 
We can take it from there.

We can take it to Easy Street.
But when things get tough on Easy Street 
What then? Is it time for realism?

And who are these guys on the bus 
Who glide in golden hats past us 
On their way to Kansas City?
