Where Somebody Died
****!****

The self  refuses to appear
          in this bare place.
 It fears that mute chair
          and the still window.
 The sunlight scares it.
 There might rise up a sound.
 The door doesn't like to move,
          and the crow out there
          hesitates; he knows
          a hole flown into by mistake
          would make a bite of   him.
 What was sits standstill in the chair,
          hangs, stunned, against the dry-eyed light.
 Nobody in sight.
 Inanimate things, still  lifeless.
 This room's so empty
          I doubt I'm standing here;
          there can't be room for me
          and total emptiness.
 Only some far-off sounds persist.
 The brute truck
          over the interstate.
 The flames in the incinerator
          chewing his old vests.
