The Second Death

So like the slow moss encroaching, this
 dark anxiety. In the bricks
 by now
and all along
 the shaded left side of the house.

 And the statue, behind her knee. Her
 ankle, in the cool
 space between her breasts, spreading
 in the earliest hours
 of the morning.

 Between her fingers.
Her parted lips.
That black-green
 whispering.
