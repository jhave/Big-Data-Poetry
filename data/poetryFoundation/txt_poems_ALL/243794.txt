The girl was known for shitting in her yard.  
I did so little for her.  She was small, a dandelion orb 
with ragged hair like an old woman's burnt from dye.  
Her face showed little sign of poverty--
it was her dusty shoes cut open at the top that told.
A bone look she'd mastered young, yet the curve 
of her face was edible, like a rounded sparrow in hand.  
She wasn't mean, but did what she wanted--quietly, 
with a lift to her chin, while I struggled to teach her anything. 
I'd like to say I brushed her brittle hair, called her beautiful, 
coaxed out sight words that dawdled on her tongue.   
I dream of her spinning like a fairy dervish in my failure.  
Consider this a prayer, a foolish one.
