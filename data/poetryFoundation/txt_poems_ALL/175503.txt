The Finger Puppets in the Attic Dollhouse

If they, more petite 
   than the mice whose flittings 
      have pillaged their robes' sparkled trim, 

stood tiptoe 
   on the plumped felt tops 
      of their thimble-sized footstools 

to scrutinize 
   the worn fabric 
      of this room's blue distances, 

would they locate 
   the source of lightning bolts 
      in our faces' wrinkled pleats 

and construe the stars' 
   dance from the tattered 
      embroidery of our steps, 

or find in our seamless 
   unravelling years 
      the tissue of apocalypse?
