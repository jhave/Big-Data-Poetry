                                                  I

You don't need always to be scrubbing the tiles, Hendrickje, 
my eye drinks itself, 
drinks itself to death--
but other drink is in short supply--
the little Buddha there,
Chinese grove god
in exchange for a ladleful of Hulstkamp,
please!

Never painted anything 
in frost-white or ice-skater blue 
or that Irish green 
in which the purple shimmers through--
always my own monotone,
my compulsion to shadows--
not pleasant
to pursue that path so clearly.

Greatness--where?
I pick up the slate-pencil and certain things appear 
on paper or canvas
or whatever the heck else--
result: Buddha bronze hocked for booze--
but I draw the line at homage under ornamental plants,
banquet of the painters' guild--
something for the boardroom!

...Creaking, 
little sheep squeaking, chromotypes
Flemish, Rubensish--
for the grandchildren 
(same idiots!) 
Ah--Hulstkamp, 
hits the spot, 
midpoint of colors, 
my shadow brown, 
stubble aura around heart and eye--


                                                 II
 
The blocked chimney smokes 
--the Swan of Avon blows his nose--
the tree stumps are wet,
clammy night, emptiness mingled with draft--
enough characters, 
the world is overpopulated as it is,
plentiful peach-fall, four rosebuds
per annum--
asperged,
set to tread the boards
by this hand,
grown wrinkled
and with sluggish veins!

All the Juliets and Ophelias, 
wreathed, silvered, sometimes murderous--
all the soft mouths, the sighs
I extracted from them--
the original actresses long since turned to smoke,
rust, leeched dry, rats' pudding--
Ariel too, away with the elements.

The age takes off its frockcoat. 
These lousy skulls of lords, 
their trains of thought
that I pushed into extremes--
my lords makers of history
all of them crowned and sceptered illiterates,
great powers of the cosmos--
yes, like so many bats or kites!

Sir Goon wrote to me lately: 
"the rest is silence”--
I think that's one of mine, 
could only be mine,
Dante dead--lacuna
of centuries
to my logomachic quotes--

what if they didn't exist, 
the booty never brought to light, 
the booths, the scaffolds, the cymbals 
never clashed--
gaps? Gap teeth maybe, 
but the great monkey jaws
would grind on
emptiness, mingled with draft--
the tree stumps are wet
and the butler snores in porter dreams.
