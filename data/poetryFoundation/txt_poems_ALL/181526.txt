Chase  Twichell

To the Reader: Twilight
****!****

Whenever I look 
out at the snowy 
mountains at this hour 
and speak directly 
into the ear of the sky, 
it's you I'm thinking of. 
You're like the spirits 
the children invent 
to inhabit the stuffed horse 
and the doll. 
I don't know who hears me. 
I don't know who speaks 
when the horse speaks.
