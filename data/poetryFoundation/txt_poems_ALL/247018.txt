The Unique Thoughts of Otherhood
****!****

After Alfred Noyes
               unmount

Umber tail mount, 
Seven bubbles, sad 
Balk of night,
Red tulip lunges. 

Incandescent felt tips,
Small ochre waves
In the nape
Of greening brick.

Simile-clad branches
Vascular, the leather
Cusp of April
Or glass leaves: 

Nest of pages
In a sweep.



               woof

Coil helix rain. 
Congregation gully up.
Cold steel compress
Her rosy ways.

Rattle a cocoon,
Three twins falling
Combat lost nap
Wool in Woolf. 

Brittle sheep tossed,
Biotic petrol lagoon:
Morning sex lyric 
Ever after umber:

Where the knobby 
Moose pins glisten.



               perroquet

Hooked rug or
Gursky's 99 cent.
By the thousand
Field, bunch, vase,

Swooped pink neckline
Tailored as crinoline
Fringed, parrot, Rembrandt
Ovoid domesticated bowl.

Swivel in red
Armless white linen,
Visualization of unnatural 
Interactive selection bias:

What the daffodil
Could not accomplish. 



               swivel

Owls curtain his 
Future, a violent 
Wave rumbling beneath
The brown floorboards.

I'm a bad 
Mother, impatient, tiny-
Fisted body crumpled
Against my chest,

Aquatic gulps of
Air, the owls,
Prickling our chests.
The bad finger

Points back, points
At the pointer.



               chisel

After Steve McCaffery's "Tyrolean Night”

Suddenness is other,
A numerical chill
Sphere machine, a
Tall Bashō bathes.

Pond jumps in 
To frog, insults 
Are all sex, 
Is mute sagas, 

Is daylight upended, 
Drunken, you sang 
The totem up:
The wind did 

What shrewd words 
So rarely do.
