****!****
Song in my heart
****!****

If there's pee on the seat it's my pee, 
battery's dead I killed it, canary at the bottom 
of the cage I bury it, like God tromping the sky 
in his undershirt carrying his brass spittoon, 
raging and sobbing in his Hush Puppy house 
slippers with the backs broke down, no Mrs. 
God to make him reasonable as he gets out 
the straight razor to slice the hair off his face, 
using the Black Sea as a mirror when everyone 
knows the Black Sea is a terrible mirror, 
like God is a terrible simile for me but like
God with his mirror, I use it.
