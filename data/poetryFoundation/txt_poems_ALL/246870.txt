I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
To make, you first have
            to create materials. Re: man, we know
the rib removed. But, before -- ? 
            Forget ash to ash, dust
                        &c.

                        Stick a floating rib (i.e. thoracic
11–12, y'know -- "Edenic”) in a glass 
            of  water with the promise
                        it'll grow
            roots like leek or fur

                        like chia. The joke's Crusoe 
            astride the bone or   Jim & Huck paddling
rustic as a ballpoint pen will go. 
            -- Nn-o.
                       (That's not a plank 
                                              in your peeper!) --

           It's a hollow; cue: running

faucet, a Pabst-crack opening
                      into seraphic 
           choir. (Risk Handel's?
   A perfect major? root, third, & fifth?) With aesthetics, 
                      like a bad comb-

                                            over, you don't
           need a mirror to know what you are
   missing. Now that you have this
                                  thing, you've got to

   feed, roof, & rock-

                      a-bye baby. You're the big boss, head honch-

    o, but watch out, foreman, Little Evie 
                       & Adam were the first 
organized union. (1-2-3-4    ...    don't give us pain in labor!)

                       So what'll you give him in return?

    Latin and genus?
                       Genius? 
                                             . . .  Medicinal plants? 

                       (I call this "Vladimir 
                                  Nabo-cough,” man.)

Or do we let him take for him-
            self   by fount, 
fin, & medium -- language. Though from this,
                       we know 
            creation is only

myth; destruction, narrative.
