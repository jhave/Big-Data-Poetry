****!****
Trying to Get Through
****!****

I make a knife of words.
I sit here waiting.
I play with crumbs.

Her eyes that should look
straight at me are
toward the window, glazed--
husband's horizon?

Not armored. Only armed
with pots and pans.
Not out of arm's reach,
beyond curtains of doorbells,
garden gates.

She puts up ironwork
in her eyes; it draws a bolt
over what's real--
then looks at me.

I wish I'd brought my saw.
