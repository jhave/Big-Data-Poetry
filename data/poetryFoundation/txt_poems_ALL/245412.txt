In English
we place a noun
meaning fixed purpose
before our verbs
to create the future
tense.


Here, in the private life
my team invents,
I'm in a floodlit kitchen
like the set
of an old-time ad
for Tide

and I am chopping 
something.


Isn't this the past
perfect?
Should I feel nostalgic?

This corn is highly 
leveraged

and I'm wearing
a pink slip.
