The sun is still burning in my skin
 even though it set half-an-hour ago,
 and Cindy and Bob and Bev and John
 are pulling on their sweatshirts
 and gathering around the fire pit.

 John hands me a cold one
 and now Bev comes into my arms
 and I can feel the sun's heat,
 and taste the Pacific on her cheek.

 I am not in Vietnam,
 nor is John or Bob, because
 our deferments came through,
 and we get to remain boys
 for at least another summer
 like this one in Santa Cruz,
 surfing the afternoons in a sweet
 blue dream I'm remembering now,

 as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep,
 and the doctor begins to burn
 those summers away.
