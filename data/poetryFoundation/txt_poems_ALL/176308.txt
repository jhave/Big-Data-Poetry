The Toothless Wonder
****!****

Last night when I was sound asleep, 
My little brother Keith 
Tiptoed into my bedroom 
And pulled out all my teeth. 

You'd think that I would be upset 
And jump and spit and swear. 
You'd think that I would tackle Keith 
And pull out all his hair. 

But no!   I'm glad he did it. 
So what if people stare. 
Now, thanks to the Tooth Fairy, 
I'll be a millionaire!
