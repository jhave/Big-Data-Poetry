The Arrival
****!****

Luggage first, the lining of his suit jacket dangling 
As always, just when you'd given up hope 
Nimbly he backs out of the taxi 

Eyes nervously extending, like brave crabs 
Everywhere at once, keeping track of his papers 
He pilots himself into the home berth 

Like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls 
Worries flutter around him so thick 
It takes him some time to arrive 

And you wonder if he's ever really been happy: 
When the blue eyes blur 
And stare out to sea 

Whether it's only a daydream 
Or a long pain that silences him 
In such gray distances 

You'll never know, but now 
Turning to you, the delicate mouth 
Like a magician 

Is curious, sensitive, playing tricks, 
Pouting like a wise turtle 
It seems he has a secret 

With the driver, 
With the stewardess on the airplane 
So that even when he opens his arms 

When the warm voice surrounds you, 
Wraps you in rough bliss, 
Just before you go under 

Suddenly you remember: 
The beloved does not come 
From nowhere: out of himself, alone 

Often he comes slowly, carefully 
After a long taxi ride 
Past many beautiful men and women 

And many dead bodies, 
Mysterious and important companions.
