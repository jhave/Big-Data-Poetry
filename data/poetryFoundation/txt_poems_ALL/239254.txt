It's a beautiful world, you said,
with these trees, marshes, deserts,
grasses, rivers and seas

and so on. And the moon is really something
in its circuits 
of relative radiance. Include

the wingèd M, voluptuous 
Venus, hotheaded Mars, that lucky devil
J and cranky Saturn, of course, plus

U and N and the wanderer P, in short 
the whole solar family, complete with its 
Milky Way, and count up all the other

systems with dots and spots and in
that endless emptiness what you've got 
is a commotion of you-know-what. It's a beautiful

universe, you said, just take a good look
through the desert's dark glasses 
for instance or on your back

in seas of grass, take a good look
at the deluge of that Rorschach--we're standing out there
somewhere, together.
