Lips
****!****

What is the structure of lips
That take care of sounds,
That can scream loud and long,
That can wait and be silent?
Yesterday I was mastering words
And kissing lips lightly--
Their loving weakness
Now remains on my own
Hardworking lips, 
Exacting, as if forever,
My terrible punishment.
