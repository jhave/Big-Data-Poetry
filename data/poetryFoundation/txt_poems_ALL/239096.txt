Record breaking Thriller
dance attempt.

                *

Wolfman Jack style
dj in the video game says,
"This is Wasteland Radio

and we're here for you”

                *

You are here

maintaining détente
between the voices
in your head.

Immediacy is retro,
says Lytle.

                 *

Nostalgic/futuristic 
scene in which

we can read the code--

green
flowing algorithms.

We can almost
slip right in.
