Reading Ovid at the Plastic Surgeon’s
****!****

I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.
No one else with a book, the slick 
weeklies gossip amongst 

themselves on the side 
tables as the ticker rolls the Dow 

Jones down down down under 
a profile of the marathon

bombers (the older, a boxer). Jove
argues for the removal of a race 

of   peoples that do not please 
him: What is past

remedy calls for the surgeon's
knife. They will take a hunk of my

cheek (cancer) & though I can't
see during the procedure, I imagine

the site as an apricot, bitten. 
This is a survival mechanism --

romanticism. David says,
If you're out

in public & you don't want anyone
to talk to you, bring a book 

of poetry. Even as I enter the confidence
of   the room, I avoid my reflection

in the window, for there, most 
of all, I see myself as only I can,

as only the eye will have me --
as light, as light alone.
