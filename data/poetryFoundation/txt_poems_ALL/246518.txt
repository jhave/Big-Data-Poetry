                                 libraries up the side of
                                         the dinner plate a
                                         little too fast
                                           not ungrateful like
             some of  these bastards around here
 can't tap out a tune with you looking away
                       genies of not enough sleep
                                a happier location for
                                         the war not the
                        easiest thing you realize
