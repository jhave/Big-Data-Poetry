Hymn for the Third Meal
****!****

Prepare the feast
       of perfect faith,
the delight of the Holy King.
       Prepare the feast of the King.

This is the feast
       of the Lesser Presence;
the Ancient Eminence and Field of Apples 
       assemble with Him for the feast.

                                    •

Sons of the Palace--
       you who yearn 
to behold the radiance 
       of the Lesser Presence--

be seated here 
       at this Sabbath table,
adorned and crowned
       with the name of the King.

Exult in your being
       part of this gathering
among the guardian
       angels' wings, 

and rejoice now 
       within this hour
of favor which knows 
       not what anger brings.

Draw near me here--
       see my power, 
without the judgments 
       of judgment's terror.

Those without 
       may not enter,
for they are dogs 
       of rancor and gall.

I hereby call
       to the Ancient of Days
to summon His will
       to drive them away--

for when His favor
       in this room is shown,
the husks are rendered
       null and void.

He drives them into
       holes in the ground,
conceals them deep
       in caverns of stone.

And so it is
       now and till twilight--
within the Impatient
       One's delight.
