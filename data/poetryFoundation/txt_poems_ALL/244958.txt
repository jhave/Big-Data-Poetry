I


here I'm here I'm here I'm

here here here here cricket

pulse -- the katydidic tick

(and then a pause) tick 

(and then a pause) in greening trees -- tales 

of a gratitude for water, the hollyhock's 

 trumpet Yes, Tenderness

her glove and hoe -- her bad trip 

love/grief, her medic tent

talking me down, kissed fissures

in the world's despair, what I'd 

loved -- alive for a while -- a day called 

Rip and Brood, a day called 

Glorious Hour, the long hunt and the worm found 

in the battered petunias -- every 

morning in summer

 that last summer

before the bees collapsed and the seas rose up 

to say Fuck You



II


perplexed by how it hadn't been 

unfailingly compatible, our

being numerous -- how half the time

we couldn't see the shapes 

we were supposed to make

 made grave our disasters -- a god's glass 

bearing down

to burn the wheat crop -- to keep time alive 

inside a tomato, splicing 

fish into fruit -- some 

wanted to defy limitation

were offered famine

bric-a-brac townships

virtual cities

 where you could stand in market aisles

 still expecting cherries



III


his rhythms were your rhythms

Murray the cat -- sleeping à deux

draped your length from hip to knee 

like a scabbard -- unsheathed his yawn

tortured finches for breakfast

yowled and yowled round the ravaged bowl

till you fed him chicken

 from your own plate

another mouth

pearling the wheel of appetite, coveting

a bloody mash 

to keep it going -- such a dumb rondeau

who invented it! 

eating to live to kill to eat, even

 cat on a stick when fields failed, no 

crave for rain against the blasted scape

nor love nor god at the end 

 of my hours, but

garlic and butter

a splash of cognac

steak frites



IV


and when soil burned and order failed 

and dogs then people starved in char I remembered

an extraordinary peace, the privilege

of   being left alone with bread to eat

 and famous butter "the chefs use,” the venues

of white sleep, cannabis and Klonopin

the soma-goods of art and when

my back went up against a blackened wall 

for rumored beans in dented cans I forgot 

 my body -- became a future remembering 

how it got that way, some

blah blah blah -- about hoarding rivers 

and hiding gold, we 

died in droves -- we killed each other and we

 killed ourselves until our bones wore out 

their plastic shrouds



V


 I couldn't quite 

quit some ideas -- trees and chocolate

I couldn't stop yammering 

over the devastated earth

pining for nachos -- prescription drugs 

 and a hint of   spring, though I could see 

the new desert -- its bumper-crop 

of   bone and brick 

from shipwrecked cities -- where now

 the sons and daughters of someone tough

are on the hunt for rat -- the scent of meat

however mean and a root

sending an antenna up, to consider 

greening -- what poems built their houses for 

once, in a blindered age, teaching us 

 the forms we felt, in rescue -- hoarded-up scraps 

whirling around my cave

trying to conjure peaches
