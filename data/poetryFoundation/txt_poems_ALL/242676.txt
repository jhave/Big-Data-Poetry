"The pond is sheathed in ice”
****!****

					
					The pond is sheathed in ice, a duck troubles the reeds, the air around us still enough to hear the baby stir, but we don't know where it is yet. By the force of our longing it is getting made for us, as thrilled people, palms full of seed, long for the chickadees to light, and they do. Light.
