‘And Their Winter and Night in Disguise’
****!****

The sea and a crescent strip of beach 
Show between the service station and a deserted shack 

A creek drains thru the beach 
Forming a ditch 
There is a discarded super-market cart in the ditch   
That beach is the edge of a nation 

There is something like shouting along the highway   
A California shouting 
On the long fast highway over the California mountains 

Point Pedro   
Its distant life 

It is impossible the world should be either good or bad   
If its colors are beautiful or if they are not beautiful   
If parts of it taste good or if no parts of it taste good   
It is as remarkable in one case as the other 
                                                                   As against this 

We have suffered fear, we know something of fear   
And of humiliation mounting to horror 

The world above the edge of the foxhole belongs to the flying bullets, leaden superbeings 
For the men grovelling in the foxhole danger, danger in being drawn to them 

These little dumps 
The poem is about them 

Our hearts are twisted   
In dead men's pride 

Dead men crowd us   
Lean over us 

In the emplacements 

The skull spins   
Empty of subject 

The hollow ego 

Flinching from the war's huge air 

Tho we are delivery boys and bartenders   

We will choke on each other 

Minds may crack 

But not for what is discovered 

Unless that everyone knew   
And kept silent 

Our minds are split 
To seek the danger out 

From among the miserable soldiers
