These years lift over coldly now: Aprils
and Augusts are gifted to ice, or sprawl
into mid-summers or year ends--pillars
of lesser standing. Still come no replies

to boyish queries, how the belly sleeper
buoys, begins again, becomes poor soul
or bull of appetite; why when the pearls
drop, no spool dares connect the ripples.
