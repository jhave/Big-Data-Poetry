Personally Engraved
****!****

There are many opportunities here for unrequited friendship,
the offer letter said. All you need is a chain saw and die grinder.

In this spirit I force my eyes across your message,
revisiting that due diligence tone you do so well.

I'm searching for some whispered twist or shout,
but all emotion's leveled, the way a child will draw

a snowman and a mansion the same size.
What is a dedicated icemaker

dedicated to? Do you really think
those shades you wear above your head

will keep the sun out of  your mind?
Rainbows stick to any abject object.

That's why I'm wearing that same old funky dress.
When you kissed my forehead it felt like the priest's

thumbscrew touch rubbing in the dust-
thou-art Ash Wednesday smudge.

I've learned the dance instructor's expository gestures.
Now I'm learning tangos to be danced alone.

While comrades buff officious cases
barfed from their brains --

eight parts moon venom one part nose waste --
I ask can mine be personally engraved?

I'm living in a please state, smarming
how I've long admired your hardscape of artists

morphed to small appliances. That being said,
I'm having issues. Do you really think

that scarf  will keep your snowman warm?
