My poems: fledglings, heirs, 
Plaintiffs and executors,
The silent ones, the loud,
The humble and the proud.

As soon as the shovel of time
Threw me onto the potter's wheel--
Myself without kith or kin--
I grew beneath the hand, a miracle.

Something stretched out my long neck
And hollowed round my soul
And marked on my back 
Legends of flowers and leaves.

I stoked the birch in the fire
As Daniel commanded
And blessed my red temper
Until I spoke as a prophet.

I had long been the earth--
Arid, ochre, forlorn since birth--
But you fell on my chest by chance
From beaks of birds, from eyes of grass.
