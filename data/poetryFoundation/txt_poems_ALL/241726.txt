The Mystery of the Hunt
****!****

It's the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me,
                    That drives us like lemmings, but cautiously--
 The search for a bright square cloud--the scent of lemon verbena--
                     Or to learn rules for the game the sea otters
                                       Play in the surf.
  
                   It is these small things--and the secret behind them
                                     That fill the heart.
                         The pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon
                                 That link them together
                       And pull their freedom into our senses, 
  
              The smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals
  
          --The rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled.
                                  It is these small things
  
                    That when brought into vision become an inferno.
