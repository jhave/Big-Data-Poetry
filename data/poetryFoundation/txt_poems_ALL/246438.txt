****!****
Descant
****!****

I left my heart in the teeth of jumper-cables-- 
black tongue, superfluous nipples . . .

By The Time I hit the yellow tape-- 
it was already turning red . . .

Of my fair and alabaster love?
My redundant chains drawn in chalk?

Halfway to the stars I stopped-- 
turned, spat--it's too late, baby . . .
