IV. The Curée (from A Quartet For the Falcon)
****!****

The secretive hart turns at bay,
lowers his tines to the hounds' cry.
The sword enters the bull's heart--
                         still he stands,
             amazed on the red sand
 as the stony unbeliever might,
 
who has seen God. Soon now
 horns will sound dedow
 for the unmaking. Beaters flush
                         the grey heron
             like a coney from its warren,
 the peregrine's jet eyes flash.
 
They go ringing up the air,
 each in its separate spiral stair
 to the indigo rim of the skies,
                         then descend
             swift as a murderer's hand
 with a knife. Death's gesture liquefies
 
in bringing the priestly heron down.
 Her prize, the marrow from a wing-bone
 in which she delights, her spurred
                         fleur-de-lys tongue
             stained gold-vermilion--
 little angel in her hangman's hood.
