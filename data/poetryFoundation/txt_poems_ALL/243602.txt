After Quevedo
****!****

In memory of Octavio Paz
not even lost in death the memory
of why we burned, and therefore still
a fire consuming all obsequious delay,
now polvo, dust, of a desire but still alive

             and aching, not even lost to you 
within our common urn, urgent as an ash
still burning alma, soul, still
and moving toward you, la muerte, my amor--

             not even lost in death, memoria,
and feeling some reply, alma, memory and ash,
ash burning still, still
and moving toward you, dust and dust, ash

             alma and amor constante
             más allá de la muerte, constant

even in our common urn, polvo enamorado.
