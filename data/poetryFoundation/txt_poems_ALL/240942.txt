Just Saying
****!****

What might be said

to disport itself

along the cinderblock

in leaves.


               *

What I write

I write instead

of ivy.


               *

Green snouts

in evidence or--

more

to the point--

insolent 

and tense.


               *

What might be said

to writhe

professionally

as the days

nod and wink.
