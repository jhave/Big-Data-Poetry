Econo Motel, Ocean City

Korean monster movie on the SyFy channel,
lurid Dora the Explorer blanket draped tentlike
over Baby's portacrib to shield us from unearned
innocence. The monster slings its carapace 
in reverse swan dive up the embankment, triple-jointed bug legs 
clattering, bathroom door ajar, exhaust roaring, 
both of us naked, monster chomps 
fast food stands, all that quilted aluminum, eats through streams
of running people, the promiscuously cheerful guilty American
scientist dies horribly. Grease-dusted ceiling fan 
paddles erratically, two spars missing. Sheets whirled 
to the polluted rug. I reach under the bed, fish out 
somebody else's crunched beer can, my forearm comes out 
dirty. Monster brachiates from bridge girders like a gibbon
looping round and around uneven bars, those are your fingers
in my tangles or my fingers, my head hangs
half off the king-size, monster takes tiny child actor
to its bone stash. Pillow's wet. The warped ceiling mirror 
makes us look like fat porno dwarfs
in centripetal silver nitrate ripples. My glasses on the side table 
tipped onto scratchproof lenses, earpieces sticking up 
like arms out of disaster rubble. Your feet hooked over my feet. What miasma
lays gold dander down on forms of temporary
survivors wandering the promenade? You pull Dora
back over us--Baby's dead to the world--intrude 
your propagandistic intimacy jokes, 
unforgiving. "What, in a motel room?” I say.
Purple clouds roll back to reveal Armageddon
a dream in bad digital unreality. Explosions repeat patterns like 
fake flames dance on fake fireplace logs. Sad Armageddon
of marriage: how pretty much nice 
we meant to be, and couldn't make a difference.
