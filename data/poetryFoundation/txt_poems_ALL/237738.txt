L Equals Look
****!****

At a book of details
Of all the moments when knowledge is acquired.

A sort of expanded balloon
Sighs and says, "We are what came before.”

"The storm in the window of the mind,”
The sleeping sister says while she's walking around

Wonderland watching
A cat touching down and talking.

Not a car in sight. A cemetery seen from the air.
All the obelisks you could ever ask for.
