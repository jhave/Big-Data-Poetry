 THERE ARE HILLS LIKE SHARKFINS
                                   and clods of mud.
 The mind drifts through
 in the shape of a museum,
 in the guise of a museum
 dreaming dead friends:
 Jim, Tom, Emmet, Bill.
 --Like billboards their huge faces droop
 and stretch on the walls,
 on the walls of the cliffs out there,
 where trees with white trunks
           makes plumes on rock ridges.
  
 My mind is fingers holding a pen.
  
 Trees with white trunks
              make plumes on rock ridges.
 Rivers of sand are memories.
 Memories make movies
              on the dust of the desert.
 Hawks with pale bellies
              perch on the cactus,
 their bodies are portholes
              to other dimensions.
  
 This might go on forever.
  
 I am a snake and a tiptoe feather
 at opposite ends of the scales
 as they balance themselves
 against each other.
 This might go on forever.
