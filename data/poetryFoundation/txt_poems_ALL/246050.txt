Pastorals in the Atrium
****!****

The tour has only started when
I'm ambushed by that flat-lined verdigris I'd know even
as a stumbling sleepwalker: landschap
with tin river, cleaver of sodden pastures -- 

marvelous for painters, 
says the docent, was the enormity
of the sky, rarely cloudless, and she's already 
turning to an Italian hillscape when I say wait! this is 

my bloodstream, as my finger makes brief
unintended contact with the canvas,
and then my voice an ambulance 
I tell her there should be a diagram 
to indicate the grazing motion, 
how the grinding molars of the Holsteins
make the river go -- 

or else, self-portrait 
in the glassing-over eye
of a stickleback caged in a jam jar, 
left too long in the sun -- 

but now the river is across the room because 
the docent has ushered me toward an upholstered bench
and is murmuring, sit, sit, I have here from the staff room
a coffee, here you are -- 

and I'm making the gesture for 
no, those fields I ate and was made of 
live in me, uncloseable 
parentheses
