Terese  Svoboda
****!****
Caned
****!****

A stick, pared clean--no, a silver-topped
bamboo-with-dagger, class doubling as club,
the advantage of gravity lifted high 
overcoming the disadvantage of poking ahead.

He demurs. Weakness either way.
A man should crush opponents with a word.
Naive, I muse, at your age. A cane
replaces the sole's sensors, bolsters them. 

Balance is a matter for the unbalanced, 
he says, all nuance, accusing me, Lear-lover,
of too much. The earth is now close, I tell him.
A sharp look. I'll walk, he says, without.
