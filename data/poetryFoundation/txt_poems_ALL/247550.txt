Jacob  Saenz
****!****
Holding Court
****!****

Today I became King
of the Court w/out a diamond-
encrusted crown thrust upon 
my sweaty head. Instead
my markings of royalty
were the t-shirt draping 
my body like a robe soaked 
in champagne & the pain
in my right knee -- a sign 
of a battle endured, my will 
tested & bested by none 
as the ball flew off my hands
as swift as an arrow toward
the heart of a target -- my fingers 
ringless yet feeling like gold.
