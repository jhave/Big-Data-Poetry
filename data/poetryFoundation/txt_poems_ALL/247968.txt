In Memory of Joe Brainard
****!****

the remnant of a vast, oceanic
bruise (wound delivered early and long ago)

was in you purity and 
sweetness self-gathered, CHOSEN

                                • 

When I tried to find words for the moral sense that unifies
and sweetens the country voices in your collage The Friendly Way,

you said It's a code.

You were a code
I yearned to decipher.--

In the end, the plague that full swift runs by
took you, broke you;--

                                          in the end, could not
                                           take you, did not break you--

you had somehow erased within you not only
meanness, but anger, the desire to punish
the universe for everything

not achieved, not tasted, seen again, touched--;

. . . the undecipherable
code unbroken even as the soul

learns once again the body it loves and hates is
made of earth, and will betray it.
