From a Finished Basement
****!****

In our arteries and eyes, a hundred lightbulbs 
throb like drugs. The furnace: 
a permanent mishap.

 And up in the dusk, there is lucid debris-- 
a conduit, a wire mask, a swastika 
of corn.

Boy- and/or girl-small, we'll find 
some horizon, an intricate faking 
in which to lose way.

Here we are, not speaking 
or dead. Here we are 
or dead.

To what do we owe this
forgetting not to kiss?
Not that any given face is not afraid.
