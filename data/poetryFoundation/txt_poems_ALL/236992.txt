An Extraordinary Morning
****!****

Two young men--you just might call them boys--
waiting for the Woodward streetcar to get 
them downtown. Yes, they're tired, they're also 
dirty, and happy. Happy because they've 
finished a short work week and if they're not rich 
they're as close to rich as they'll ever be 
in this town. Are they truly brothers? 
You could ask the husky one, the one 
in the black jacket he fills to bursting; 
he seems friendly enough, snapping 
his fingers while he shakes his ass and sings 
"Sweet Lorraine,” or if you're put off 
by his mocking tone ask the one leaning 
against the locked door of Ruby's Rib Shack, 
the one whose eyelids flutter in time 
with nothing. Tell him it's crucial to know 
if in truth this is brotherly love. He won't 
get angry, he's too tired for anger, 
too relieved to be here, he won't even laugh 
though he'll find you silly. It's Thursday, 
maybe a holy day somewhere else, maybe 
the Sabbath, but these two, neither devout 
nor cynical, have no idea how to worship 
except by doing what they're doing, 
singing a song about a woman they love 
merely for her name, breathing in and out 
the used and soiled air they wouldn't know 
how to live without, and by filling 
the twin bodies they've disguised as filth.
