Less lonely, less . . .
I gave you 
a tiny box. 
You lifted the lid, 
praised 
the usefulness 
of my gift: 
a silver pin shaped 
like an amper-
sand. As you fastened it 
to your lapel, 
I thought again of 
that motel 
outside of Chicago. 
¿Te acuerdas?
I sat on the edge 
of a bench, 
untied my shoes. 
Face down, eyes shut, 
you breathed in
the aroma 
of sweat & allspice 
coming off 
the sheets. I tossed 
my ring--gold, 
inscribed--toward a pile 
of clothes. 
But the ring 
dropped in the small 
of your back 
where it rattled 
& rattled like a coin 
in a beggar's 
cup.
