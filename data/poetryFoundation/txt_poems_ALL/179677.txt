The father died and then the mother died. 
                  And you were so addicted 

to not feeling them, you told no one about the clamp   
                  inside-- 

around the vena cava. Dam against the blood's 
                  trash-- 

But I've got you now. Trussed at the waist   
                  in a wooden chair, 

odor of spice and   
                  oranges, clove-pierced, incandescent stores   

                  to light our lab's decor-- 

Here. I saved this just for you. 
                  Beetle-cleaned and sharp at the tip, the finger that shook 

in your set face   
                  from the hand that smoothed your hair-- 

Make a fist. 
                  Wrap the tube round your fleshy arm, pull the black rubber 

tight-- 
                  will we finally 

see the sludge of their accumulated mouths, ah, you've said, 
                  how they poisoned me... 

Pierce in   
                  with your mother's finger-bone, taste the slow up-well-- 

Sweet. 
                   Sweet. Surge ambrosial and clear-- 

A honey, an ichor.   
                   From those who waited long   

                   in your veins.
