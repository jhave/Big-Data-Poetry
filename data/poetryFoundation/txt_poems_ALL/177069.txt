Wondered Knob-Cracker at Stout-Heart:   
‘Are you timed by your will, does your pulse   
List credit, ready to slam like a till? 
Can you keep it up?' 

Growled Beard Splitter to Smug: 
‘Your forces delay, bibbing at Northern walls   
While snow drives rifts between, barring the way.   
I am sufficient.' 

Pleaded Knob-Cracker with Fail-Safe: 
‘You've boarded at last, your hands in your pockets,   
Hat on the back of your head and flags up the mast.   
Can't I come with you?' 

Nodded Beard-Splitter to Sorrowful: 
‘The islands are prisons and no one returns,   
No power or possessions where my rule is.   
I will make you mine.'
