‘Are you asleep?' 
Like a door that always opens 
on the same empty closet, 
the old jokey question 
you can never answer ‘yes' to 
is a snap, in comparison 
to ‘Where are you?' 

Moving, wherever you are. 
Even your stillness on the back seat takes 
the bent of action, a kicking reach 
through swells and drifts of afghan. 
My live question mark, 
are they salt or sweet, the waters 
you riddle? 

Asking gets me as far 
as ladling water with a net. 
Though I can catch your small 
beached foot, and hear 
soft waves of breath, the mesh 
of senses isn't fine enough 
to land you now. 

When you come back, 
you'll rub the sand from your eyes 
and know nothing of where you've been. 
Love is like that: the element 
we breathe and move through, 
untouchable and always 
there.
