I don't have any sentiments 
would somebodything thirst my quench 
how about 
about my mediocrity of character? I dance 
with the dead divinely 
                                 in my dreams 
I'm stricken deaf when I mention it my babies 
cry they want everything quick! here. un- 
mentioned    
                  as character should be 
      like the purpurine it needs must be carved in,   
                        please 

Have you heard of the roguess elephant with the   
brilliant diamond eyes? She is the puppet 
of the dictionary 
                           where is her beautiful orange   
juice?    
            puppy foot!      
                                 When your father dies 
he doesn't let you swoon    
                                       into aventurine or spray   
of lily (pearls) of the valley 
you do not bifurcate 
                               you may 
supplicate       
                   play yourself to your camp heroine   
self--play it Lady play 
It       
       but delete no matter 
       thank you for breakfast 
       today we will visit with the ear syringe   
       be the current density      
                                           honey flower 
                                           ice egg 
I love you as a fan loves air. oops it's I 
                vice-versa I 
                                  told you about that 
       character         
                           She is a bezel 
                           awaiting the plop of a   
                           ruby she must grow   
                           chronically 

and I can't end and I can't lie 
here            
               He held him in his own heart then   
               may I in my eye now me
