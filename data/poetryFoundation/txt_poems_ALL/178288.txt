An Awful Story
****!****

When she came into his room he was asleep   
and when she touched him, he woke-- 
her hand on his shoulder, her knee at his mouth,   
and in the darkness, she looked like a boy. 

When he tried to sit up she covered his ears   
with her hands: "Save ourselves from ourselves,”   
she said, and then a wind stirred in the room   
as if she'd placed those words in his mouth.
