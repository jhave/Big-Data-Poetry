Winter Psalm
****!****

Boston snowbound, Logan closed, snowplows
 and salt-trucks flashing yellow, drifts
 tall as a man some places, visibility poor,
 I sit by the window and watch the snow
 
blow sideways north-northeast, hot cup
 in hand, robe over pajamas.
 You have made me to seek refuge
 and charged me to care for my brothers.
 
How cruel. That could be You out there
 howling, cracking the trees, burying everything.
 What could I possibly want from You
 that would not undo the whole world as it is?
