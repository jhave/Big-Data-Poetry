Enoch’s Blocks
****!****

Little Enoch learned his colors from lettered blocks

(for a is the color of fleet,
b is the color of war and demolition,
c is the color of echo and blur,
&c.) and built
a bricolage:

So cab was a whirring warbler.
bach was the Spanish Armada crashing
                                      and crashing.
And enoch he couldn't describe.

And when it reached the height of Enoch,
standing, he tore whole tongues
down to their colors.
