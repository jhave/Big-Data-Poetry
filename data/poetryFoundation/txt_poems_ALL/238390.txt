Only she who has breast-fed
knows how beautiful the ear is.
Only they who have been breast-fed
know the beauty of the clavicle.
Only to humans the Creator 
has given the earlobe.
The humans, through clavicles 
slightly resembling birds, 
entwined in caresses fly
to the place at night where, 
rocking the cradle of cradles, 
the babe is wailing, 
where on a pillow of air 
the stars nestle like toys.
And some of them speak.
