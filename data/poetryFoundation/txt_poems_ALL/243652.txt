****!****

The Nut Garden holds things felt and thought
and feeling for thought is always a palace--

Sinai with flames of fire about it,
burning though never by fire devoured.

entrance is barred to pretenders forever.

For one who learns to be wise, however,
its doors are open toward the East: 

he reaches out and takes a nut,
then cracks its shell, and eats...
