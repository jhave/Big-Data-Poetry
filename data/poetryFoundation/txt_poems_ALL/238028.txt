Spring
****!****

Mother tried to take her life. 
The icicles thawed. 
The house, a wet coat 
we couldn't put back on. 

Still, the garden quickened, 
the fields were firm. 
Birds flew from the woods'
fingertips. Among the petals 

and sticks and browning fruit, 
we sat in the grass and 
bickered, chained daisies, prayed. 
All that falls is caught. Unless 

it doesn't stop, like moonlight,
which has no pace to speak of,
falling through the cedar limbs,
falling through the rock.
