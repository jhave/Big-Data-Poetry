A Bowl of Spaghetti

"To find a connectome, or the mental makeup of a person,”
researchers experimented with the neurons of a worm

then upgraded to mouse hoping 
"to unravel the millions of miles of wire in the [human] brain”

that they liken to "untangling a bowl of spaghetti”

of which I have an old photo: Rei in her high chair delicately
picking out each strand to mash in her mouth.

Was she two? Was that sailor dress from Mother?
Did I cook from scratch? If so, there was a carrot in the sauce

as Mother instructed and I'll never forget 
since some strand determines infatuation as a daughter's fate.
