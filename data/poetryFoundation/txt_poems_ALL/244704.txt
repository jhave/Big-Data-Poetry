She expects nothing but to witness our lives 
and find kindness and why shouldn't she 
but for the boiling water my partner spills 
on my arm and the FUCK'S SAKE 
that escapes my mouth now the snout 
of the spitting mammal in me. 
If there's a craft to the failing of simple 
expectations, I have mastered it 
and majestically--but when there's something 
that must be said, it must be said, 
Lispector says of a woman entering 
an empty room and finding a version 
of herself so dark it makes her pause 
and really see it, how she's no better 
than the cockroach in her closet 
and so she eats it.
