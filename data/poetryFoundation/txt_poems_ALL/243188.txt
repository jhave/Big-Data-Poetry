****!****
Queen, you are fathomed
****!****

Exalted life
                         this

not because you know
slavish attention 
                                     or sit

bathed in the royal jellies
     and rarer distillates

nor because it commences
             backlit all 

by droning buzz and the mellow

                scent of lilac


                       but for your ignorance of desire

                       for your cloistering, Liege

Never wondering
               what tastes abound 
           in distant clusters

                                               so rich is your interior
                                                           your fecundity

                          your multiple dark imaginings

Never saying
                          as I do
            Why         and again                 Why

Never saying
                          as I do
                          to the world of surrounding combs

          Do you think I may someday escape
