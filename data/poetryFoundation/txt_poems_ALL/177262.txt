What had you been thinking about 
the face studiously bloodied 
heaven blotted region 
I go on loving you like water but 
there is a terrible breath in the way all of this   
You were not elected president, yet won the race   
All the way through fog and drizzle 
When you read it was sincere the coasts 
stammered with unintentional villages the   
horse strains fatigued I guess . . . the calls . . . 
I worry 

the water beetle head 
why of course reflecting all 
then you redid you were breathing 
I thought going down to mail this 
of the kettle you jabbered as easily in the yard   
you come through but 
are incomparable the lovely tent 
mystery you don't want surrounded the real   
you dance 
in the spring there was clouds 

The mulatress approached in the hall--the 
lettering easily visible along the edge of the Times 
in a moment the bell would ring but there was time   
for the carnation laughed here are a couple of "other” 

to one in yon house 
The doctor and Philip had come over the road 
Turning in toward the corner of the wall his hat on 
reading it carelessly as if to tell you your fears were justified   
the blood shifted you know those walls 
wind off the earth had made him shrink 
undeniably an oboe now the young 
were there there was candy 
to decide the sharp edge of the garment 
like a particular cry not intervening called the dog "he's coming! he's coming” with an emotion felt it sink into peace   
there was no turning back but the end was in sight 
he chose this moment to ask her in detail about her family and the others   
The person.   pleaded--"have more of these 
not stripes on the tunic--or the porch chairs 
will teach you about men--what it means” 
to be one in a million pink stripe 
and now could go away the three approached the doghouse   
the reef.   Your daughter's 
dream of my son understand prejudice 
darkness in the hole 
the patient finished 
They could all go home now the hole was dark 
lilacs blowing across his face glad he brought you
