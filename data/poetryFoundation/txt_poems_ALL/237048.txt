I Google Myself
****!****

I Google myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you to Google me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I Google myself
I want you to remind me



I don't Google anybody else
When I think about you 
I Google myself
Ooh
I don't Google anybody else
At home alone in the middle of the night
I Google myself



I Google myself
And see you before me
Any fool could see
Just how much I Google myself
Get down on your knees &
Friend me and Poke me



I don't Google anybody else
When I think about you
I Google myself
Ooh I don't Google anybody else
At home alone in the middle of the night
I Google myself
and I like what I see
Oh oh oh oh I can't stop Googling myself
1,690,000 results for Googling myself
When I haven't Googled myself for a while
You're the sun who makes me shine
I'm one of millions who constantly Google themselves
I want to make you mine
I don't Google anybody else
And when I think about you I Google myself
Ooh, ooh, oo, oo ahh
