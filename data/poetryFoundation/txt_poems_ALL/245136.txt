Not for You, Not for the World

					Because a little reprieve, a little hope (even for those whom I love)would exculpate the world of  its actions, I hold to logic steadfast.Belief, without knowledge, dislodges perception of all the empirical world-- (even for you, mom and dad). Know that if, for you, on some filthy lieI could wish for the mind's persistence after death, I would say no.
