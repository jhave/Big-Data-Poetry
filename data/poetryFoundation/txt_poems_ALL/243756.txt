John Hancock’s John Hancock

makes wind
the way it whirls
about and blows
the neighboring names
of other signatories
away. The point
of it is not
the John or Jane
Doe it names;
the point's the quill
in motion as if
still stuck 
and aquiver in 
goose skin. 
The trick to writing
well isn't up
the sleeve. It is 
the sleeve
that fluffs up 
the flourish,
that blooms around
the stunted stamens
of the fingers
and distracts us
from our grasping
for the sun
or the uncertain
scratching
of the stylus.
