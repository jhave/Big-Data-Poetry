The Fluffer Talks of Eternity
****!****

I can only give you back what you imagine.
I am a soulless man. When I take you 
into my mouth, it is not my mouth. It is
an unlit pit, an aperture opened just enough
in the pinhole camera to capture the shade.

I have caused you to rise up to me, and I
have watched as you rose and waned.
Our times together have been innumerable. Still,
like a Capistrano swallow, you come back.
You understand: I understand you. Understand
each jiggle and tug. Your pudgy, mercurial wad.

I am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours 
could never be. You're nevertheless prepared to shoot.
If I could I'd finish you. Be more than just your rag.
