Stonehenge

Each morning he'd anoint the room's four corners 
with an arc of piss, and then--until 
he was forcibly halted--beat his forehead open
on the eastern wall, the “sunrise wall,” 
incanting a doggerel prayer about God
the Flower, God of the Hot Plucked Heart; and
she, if loose in the halls, would join him,
squatting in the center of the room and masturbating 
with a stolen bar of soap. This isn't why 
they were sent to the madhouse: this is what 
they needed to do once in the madhouse: this 
is the only meaningful ritual they could fashion 
there, created from the few, make-do 
materials available. It isn't wondrous strange 
more than the mega-boozhwah formulaic splendor 
of my sister's wedding ten, eleven years ago: 
her opulent bouquet of plastic flowers 
(for the wilting pour of wattage at the photo session), 
nigglingly arranged to match the real bouquet 
she carried down the aisle, bloom per bloom; 
the five-foot Taj Mahal of sculpted pastel sherbet; 
endless “Fiddler on the Roof”; I'm sorry 
now I cranked my academic sneer hauteur in place 
all night. I'm sorry I didn't lose myself 
like a drunken bee in a room-sized rose, 
in waltzing Auntie Sally to the lush swell 
of the band. We need this thing. There's not one 
mineral in Stonehenge that our blood can't also raise. 
One dusk, one vividly contusion-color 
dusk, with my fists in my pockets and 
a puzzle of fish-rib clouds in the sky, I 
stopped at the low-level glow of a basement window 
(Hot Good Noodle Shop) and furtively looked in:
a full-grown pig was splayed on the table,
stunned but fitfully twitching, it looked as if
it had grasshoppers under its skin. A man and a woman 
slit that body jaw-to-ass with an ornate knife, 
and then they both scooped out a tumble 
of many dozens of wasps, preserved
by the oils of living pig to a beautiful black and amber 
gem-like sheen. I saw it. Did I
see it? From inside this, over their wrists 
in the tripes, they carefully removed
the wooden doll of a man and the wooden doll of a woman 
maybe two inches tall, a tiny lacquered sun 
and matching brass coin of a moon, and then 
a child's-third-grade-version of a house 
made out of pallid wax: a square of walls, 
a pyramid roof, and a real smoking chimney.
