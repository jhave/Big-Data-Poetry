‘out of poverty
to begin

again'    impoverished

of tone of pose that common
wealth

of parlance   Who
so poor the words

would   with   and   take on substantial

meaning   handholds   footholds

to dig in one's heels   sliding

hands and heels beyond the residential
lots   the plots   it is a poem

which may be sung
may well be sung
