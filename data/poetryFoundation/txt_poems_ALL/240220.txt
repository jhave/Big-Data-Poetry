You can't trust lesbians. You invite them 

to your party and they don't come, 
they're too busy tending vaginal 
flowers, hating football, walking their golden 
and chocolate labs. X gave me a poem 

in which she was in love with a woman 
and the church but the church 
couldn't accept four breasts in one bed. 
When I asked if our coworkers knew, 

she dropped her head and I said nothing 
for years until this morning I realized 
no one reads poems: my secrets and hers
are safe in verse. I knew she'd have enjoyed 

the Beaujolais and I want to meet Dianne, 
Mona Lisa, Betty, Alice, 
the name's been changed 
to protect women who can't stand in a room 
holding hands because you can't trust 
heterosexuals to love love, however 
it comes. So I recorded 

the party for her, for them, the mic
a bit away from the action 
to catch the feel of waves touching shore 
and letting go, the wash of moods 
across the hours of drink and yes, some grapes 
were thrown and I breathed 
the quickening revelation
of a cigarette, someone said "I gave up 
underwear for Lent” and I hope 

they play the tape while making love. 
As if finally the world's made happy 
by who they are, laughing with, not at 
the nipple lick clit kiss hug
in bed and after, the on and on 
of meals and moons and bills 
and burning days of pretending 
they don't exist. "Who's she? Just 

a friend.” And oceans are merely dew
upon the land.
