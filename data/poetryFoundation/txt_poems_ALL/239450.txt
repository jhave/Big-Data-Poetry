 [The robots roll and lurch and glide onstage as a single mass of parts, an animated scaffold of struts and gears. The elements of this jumble devolve into separate robots who become gradually more humanoid until at the end they have become the actual, human characters.Partway through the process:]                          robot leader          Units assembled for the ritual          Performance at command,          As the Human Creators have ordained,          In memory of the Past.                         robot two           This concept I cannot understand,          At the center of the drama--          What is this          "Death”--Is it a form of waste?                         robot three           I cannot comprehend, I cannot understand:          If the information of one unit might be lost          It is backed up by any other unit at hand:          What is this          "Death”--Is it an excessive cost?                         robot four           How can information end?          Is it a form of entropy?          Why did the Human Creators          Before they departed intend          To require a performance on a theme          Impossible to comprehend?          Is it the data rearranged,          As in an error, in a dream?          A real jumble?          Data in memory misplaced          In a random scramble--          Dream-data, the order changed;          That would be something          I could comprehend,          If only the form was changed.          Is that the meaning of this          "Death”--data rearranged?          A dream of something lost          That was meant to be saved?          An unrecovered past?          What is suffering?           How can I perceive           What I cannot feel?                          robot three          What can we learn?          What can we gain,          From inferior matter?[Just before the process of transformation is completed:]                          robot leader          All we can understand          Is the Human Creators' command:          In memory of the Original Past          And the Organic Age,          We perform this drama          We cannot understand.          Whatever the score and script intend          By this undefined "Death”--          Although the meaning is lost,          Back in the Organic Age,          We perform, to obey their command.          Whatever the Human Creators planned          Before they departed--          Units deployed as Individuals will receive          One Thousand Human Rights Status Credits.          Now, it is time we started. [They have transformed themselves into human performers or characters. They have created the house of Simon Powers and his family. An elegant room, cluttered but expensive, half high-tech operating room and half Victorian salon. An elaborate metallic sculpture of a bird. A full-length portrait of young Simon.We see the two women, Evvy and Miranda; in his lab coat at a wall of instruments, Nicholas; in his wheelchair, trailing wires and tubes and holding a Frankenstein's monster mask over his face in his one good arm, Simon.]

                          simon           [Lowers the Frankenstein's monster mask]           "Once out of Nature I will never take          My bodily form from any natural thing,          But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make          From hammered gold and gold enameling . . . ”          Da-da, da-da, mechanical parakeet . . .           "And set upon a golden bough to sing.”          Ah, the immortal William Yeats!          He can have his bird.          Yeats, I give you the bird!                         evvy          Simon, please be serious.          Or at least be frightened          Or show that you are frightened.          I feel you already          Vanishing into this machine.          Out of nature--into a machine!          If you were frightened          I would be less worried.          Will you go insane,          Out of nature,          In the machine?                         simon [Raises the mask back to his face for a moment.]          The machine is part of nature!          For every machine that makes nature better--          Like the System that I will enter--          Nature made the maker          Of that machine. [Removes mask: his head rests in a brace, suggesting paralysis, though the wheelchair keeps moving as if nervously pacing. His one arm and his face are animated, but the head does not move.]           Nature is the begetter           Of every inventor           So machines are made by nature:          The great Organic Machine.[Flips the mask aside.]                          nicholas          There isn't much more time, the body          Is dying, now it's time to enter the system?                         simon          Thank you, Nick, for reminding me--          In the stroke of time, in the nick of time.          Nick will rescue me from my stroke.          Miranda, my child, come talk to me!          And Evvy, my favorite, my beloved          And final wife,          Come join in the celebration.                         nicholas          There isn't time.                         simon          There's always time.          Miranda, come talk to me!          Evvy, everything is new.          My flesh and blood,          And my loved wife,          It's a new life:          Let's talk about our plans--          I have a lot to do this afternoon,          After I die!                         miranda          Nicholas says there isn't time.          Because--it's time.          I'm afraid it's time--          And I'm afraid.                         simon          And so, I'm not out of time.          But soon I'll be out of matter!          Yes I'll be out of matter,          But I will still be rich!                         nicholas          Now it is time![While Simon sings the next words, Nicholas is adjusting the device, attaching it to Simon, fussing with parts of Simon's body and with the "infernal device”of the room.]                         simon          Once, when Miranda was three years old          She put her hand to her throat          Just here above the voice-box          And felt the vibration.          She said: "I can feel it when I talk--          That must mean Miranda is inside.”          And she was right!          You were right,          My intelligent daughter:          It's the vibration,          The movement, that matters!          That's what I love in you--          The voice, the gesture:          The ripple, not the water!          And that's how I got rich!                         miranda          Daddy, where will you be?                         simon          It doesn't matter!          Maybe in a bird, like the immortal Yeats.          Maybe in my portrait by some          Immortal painter whose immortal          Name I forget!                         nicholas          We must leave the body          And launch him into the system          In the next few minutes.                         simon          Evvy, she is like a daughter to you?          Miranda, she has been a mother to you?                         miranda          Yes, she is like a mother.                         evvy          My child--I have no other.                         simon          Then you see--it's true!          It isn't the blood,          It isn't the bone.          It's never the matter that matters.          Particles, molecules, cells, fingers, eyes, nerves          Are only places for the system          Of meaningful vibrations.          It's all in the meaning, the movement,          The idea--that's the idea.          It's never the clones, the bones, the          Silicon chips, skinflick rips.          It's what you adopt,          And how you adapt.          They were all amazed          How a tinkerer like me          Could be such a shrewd investor.          I looked for the movement, the vibration,          Not the matter, the system!          And that's how I got rich!          It's not the hog bellies, hope chests,          Chest of gold, heads of state,          Skin, the belly, chest, head:          The matter is just a medium,          The system is the idea.                         miranda & evvy & nicholas[Then joined by Simon.]          The matter is mortal          But the system lives on          The matter is mulch          The matter is static          The matter is zilch--          But the system is movement, the ideal          Is real and the idea persists.                         simon          It made me rich!          Skin flicks, hog bellies, hope chests, heads of state.          Skin, belly, chest, head--          Why freeze your head when you're dead?          It's only meat! If I keep a little of my meat          For old time's sake, what the hell,          A meaty souvenir--          It won't be the skull!          I'll save the heart,          Or some other juicy part. [Simon is taken away by Nicholas. Miranda and Evvy, like the audience, can no longer see him.]                         miranda          How will we speak to you?          Will you be some one place?          When you're all a vibration          Without any one face          We could know you with?                         evvy          Will I know what is you          Without any breath?          Will it be your voice?          Or a simulation?                         miranda & evvy          What will I know,          What will I do,          How will my ears          Know what they hear?          How will my hands          Know what they touch?          How will it be you,          And how will I know?                         simon          What does it matter?          Simulation, place,          Medium, voice,          Face, shmace--          As many as I want,          Faces and voices.          Now I am almost purely,          Entirely,          Into the system          I'm nearly          Out of matter.          But maybe I'm not          Out of time.                         evvy          But how can you be yourself,          Without a body?          How will I know you, my husband,          How will you know me?                         simon          Maybe as a bird, maybe          As a dog, a horse, a house:          "Body my house          my horse my hound          what will I do          when you are fallen          Where will I sleep          How will I ride          What will I hunt . . .           when Body my good           bright dog is dead.”          So said the immortal May Swenson--          I'll be more immortal than her and that peculiar bird          The immortal William Yeats. [Nods to Nicholas.]           Now!          See you later![Nicholas turns a switch or two, hits the return key, etc., and Simon slumps forward. The room shakes a bit. The metal bird stirs, stretches its wings, squawks a little. The portrait of young Simon becomes animated, looks around the room.]                         evvy          What now?

Scene Two
[Miranda and Nicholas are in the room, which continues to stir mysteriously, an animated environment. The portrait, the bird, other objects, pulse or shift like sleeping animals.]                           simon [Muttering, half-whispered.]           Remember.          Nearer . . . ardor . . .           Closer . . . higher . . .          Search-it . . . circuit . . .           Memory tempered,          Torturous choir:          Dismembered, afire,          No matter the matter--          I did that.          I am the same.          The name and the matter,          Touch and desire.          Doing, undoing          Dissemble the fire.          Remember: I did that.          Much in a wire.          The closer the harder          What was the matter?          Scorched in a circle,          Encumbered, remember:          I am the same.          The memory chamber          Touch too much, too          Much unremembered          As I drew nearer.          Touch not enough          To the light expiring          That matter encumbered.          Remembered assembly,          Circle of touch, torch          Lighting the chamber          Where I am the same.          Remember.          Torch and desire          Disassembled memory          As I draw nearer          Over and over and over. . . .          Couched in a wire          Closer and higher          Search it in the circuit          Dismembered, afire,          Resembled ensemble          Assembled entire,          Trembling to acquire          A semblance of fire.          Remember:          Whatever I did          I did that and          I am the same.[By the end of the scene, there is no trace left of Simon's human body.] 
*     *     * Scene Three
                         miranda          He has been silent all last night          And all day.          These things are alive, this place--          But is my father alive? Is he here?          Can he speak?          When can we hear his voice?                          nicholas          Where is Evvy?                          miranda          Finally asleep. She's afraid          That he's lost forever.          Can you help us hear him?                          nicholas          Yes!--He helped me, now I'll help him.          They said I was a vegetable          Or a piece of meat.          He gave me a new body,          Made of graphite and magnesium,          Titanium alloy and copper--          Better than meat!          When I was a kid          And he had           More money than God,          He came into the ward          And saved me at random.          Now, I'll help him live in the System.          The way he helped me:          I'll help him live without a body--          Post-Organic, like me!                         nicholas [Nicholas's "Song To His Arms”; holds up his right arm.]           One arm of bone and gristle, nerves and muscle--          Mortal, fallible, breakable.          Saved by the idea, saved by the System. [Holds up his left arm, a mechanized prosthesis, an openwork of rods and cables.]           One arm of magnesium and nickel,           Graphite, silicon, and cable--          Mortal, fallible, breakable.           Perfection of the soul-ware          Capable of renewal          Never in the matter.                          miranda          This room          Is all of him?                          nicholas          Not the room, or the arm,          Always the system,           All in the principle          That moves the cable and moves the muscle.                          miranda          Can we hear his voice?          Is he only this place?                         nicholas          Like my left arm, that is mine          Not me,          Like a tool or a baby's rattle.          So is his voice, so is this place.          And the right arm, too, is mine          Not me.          Like my skull lined with gristle          So too his voice, so too this place.          Even the brain in its shell,          As mortal, as fallible, as breakable.          As the clone the bone the hardest stone          All mortal and material--          I can help him, in the real.          Not in silicon, titanium, or nickel          Not hammered and enameled--          Immaterial and immortal!          Chrome and nickel, silicon and graphite.          All get tired and old.          Only the form is real.          Only the system can hold.          Now we can hear his voice:          What is your name? [The artist's version of young Simon steps hesitantly from the portrait. His movements are subtly but distinctly unnatural, even mechanical. He moves somewhat as the robots did as they began taking on their roles.]                          simon          What is my name?          A name is a machine.          A name is a made-up thing          That proposes someone is real.          My name is          A machine for designation--          That's what any name is.          My name is Simon Walter Powers,          It proposes I am alive.          Like my spiritual mentors          The immortal Walter Disney          And the immortal Walter Whitman,          My fellow Walters          And fellow-inventors.          And by the way,          I have billions of bucks,          And I can still sign checks.           That's what!                          miranda          The gestures are unreal          And so is the face          But this is how he talks          And this is his voice.                         nicholas          Who is the president of the United States? [The young Simon has receded back into the portrait. Simon's voice now emerges from the bird.]                          simon          A man who wants my favor,          A man who courts my power,          A guy who wants to meet my movie stars,          And wants to use my billions.          That's who.                         miranda          Daddy, is it you in there?          And can you hear me?                         nicholas          In a moment we will try          To see if he can hear you.          What is your business?

[The middle of the night. Evvy enters in a daze, nearly as if sleepwalking. Evvy speaks with the disembodied Simon.]                          evvy          Simon, do you remember the first time we danced?                         simon          In the parking lot near the Francis Drake Hotel.                          evvy          They had the windows open and we could hear the band.                          simon          "Begin the Beguine.” I remember the terrace.                         evvy          On the other side remember of the tall hedge.                         simon          A tall hedge of pittosporum. I remember.                         evvy          And the smell I remember of night jasmine.                         simon          Your dress pink your pearls in as I remember two strands.                         evvy          Held together I remember by a little silver bangle.                         simon          I remember, love. And we danced for joy. Remember?                         evvy          It's hard to get used to seeing you like this. Do you want to live forever?                         simon          People say "forever,” they say,          "Do you want to live forever!”          And people say, "enough”:          "Haven't you had enough?”          Wrong questions!          It's not forever! It's not "enough”!          It's . . . more!          Don't talk about enough!          Enough never is enough!          It's more!          Ask anybody how much money          Would be enough for you?          Just about everybody          Says double what they have          Or double what they make:          More!          What's enough being alive?          Why does the crushed bug          Keep waving a leg? That wave          Is for more, more, and more.          Forever doesn't matter.          Enough isn't good enough.          What matters is more.          And if you think you've got          Three score years and ten          Then what you want is not          To outlive the sun,          But a hundred and forty--more!          Forever is not the point.          All that matters is more.          Don't talk about enough,          There's no such thing--          What you want is more:          More, more, more.                         evvy          Touch me.          O yes that.          And some this.          And this again, yes.          And more of that.          O yes both and that          Too and this other and O          More this.          And that.          And the other.          O.          Yes, yes that and          The other          And this and that and more and all          And the other and O yes           All yes all yes, all yes.          Touch me.          I remember.

Scene Five
[Nicholas alone. He now has two prosthetic arms and a prosthetic leg, but glides about efficiently, as though he has become part-Segway. He is fiddling with the now more-elaborate bird and portrait, which seem more alive than ever, as does the entire room. Robots are bustling about to assist him. Miranda enters, apparently accustomed to this new, stranger atmosphere.]                          miranda          They are here--          The important delegation          From the United Way,          The Administration          And the United Nations--          They want to speak to him, they say          They want his ear.          They say it's regarding          Matters of the whole          Planet's life and death.                         nicholas          They want his ear?          Don't they understand?          He doesn't hear with ears,          He doesn't speak with breath. [Nicholas gleefully sheds another part of his human-looking body. Robots are dancing (vocalizing).]           He says they should speak with Evvy,          She handles that kind of thing.                         miranda          The whole planet--famine, war,          The exploitation of children . . .          The whole planet . . .          They know Evvy isn't the same.          They know she doesn't listen          To anything but him.          I myself don't know          If she hears him or not.          Here she comes.          Evvy, dear--          Did you speak with the delegation? [Evvy enters wearing headphones, swaying a little as if to music, nodding and tilting her head as if in conversation. She appears not to hear Miranda.]                          evvy          Mmmm.                         nicholas          Evvy, can you hear Simon?                         evvy          Mmmmmm.                         miranda          Are you listening to him?          Does he know that the delegation . . .                         evvy          Mmmmmmm.                         miranda          The whole planet . . .                         nicholas          Are you listening for him?                         evvy          Mmmmmmmm.                         miranda          Her mind is not in this world.          Simon, Daddy--are you there?          Are you speaking to her?          Will you see the delegation          From the United Way,          The Administration          And the United Nations?          The devastation . . . the children . . . the planet . . .          Will you listen?                         nicholas          They want his ear,          They want his eye--          Those parts are dead and buried!          He's rather cranky          And weary today.          Send the delegation on its way.          Send them away.          miranda          I can't send away          A delegation from the world--          The Outside World Itself.          The children . . . the devastation . . .

[But no--she goes dreamy again, shakes her head, recedes.]           Mmmmmmmm.          simon's voice          Bring in the delegation          From the Outside World Itself.          I will see it and hear it          For two minutes.

As it persists, in the "breathing” room, they gradually all come to look at Nicholas.]                         nicholas          He chooses not to answer.

"Group of Young Men Beats Nurse to Death” "A group of young men taking part in coming-of-age rituals due to include circumcision turned on their male nurse and killed him, an official said yesterday. A spokesman for the provincial Health Department said the young men, ages 18 to 25, beat the man to death with sticks at the site of their initiation ceremonies in Port Angel on Friday evening. The attack followed complaints by the men that they were not being properly looked after during their initiation ceremonies. The nurse was in charge of caring for the men ahead of their circumcision.”
                         the administration          What?

I don't even need to sign checks:          I am the software, the system.          I control the money and power.

And you don't understand poetry.          And Da kam ein Engelein und wollt' mich abweisen,          And I'm in control,          And I'm getting bored with you all.

Like any other          Person, I am someone's child          I want at least          Something like a mother          Something of flesh and blood.          I miss having a father          Of flesh and blood.          I need to touch my mother.                         evvy[Seeming to feel something, but we can't be sure.]          Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. 
*     *     *Scene Six
[Miranda, Evvy, the now semi-robotic Nicholas, whose head may be on a shelf or cranny of the Segway-like body.]                          nicholas          Still, I do wonder--          Now that we are ready          To leave the last bit          Of these mortal bodies,          I do wonder          Why does he choose          More and more          To live away from the world.          The senses will be stronger,          Not weaker.          The body will do more,          Not less.          The mind will be free.          The senses will be pure,          More and more.                         miranda          What will it feel like?          What does he feel?                         evvy [She removes the headphones, and regains focus.]           I will tell you what it is like.          I have been listening to Simon.          It's like when we fell in love.          This is what it is like:          When you stand on a high building          Or on a bridge and you want to jump off          Something in you wants to jump off,          To feel what it might be like to fall.          You can jump. You can fall.          You can fall forever, and do it again.          You are free to keep on falling forever          You are free to fall and change your mind          And drift back up.          I've been listening to Simon.          Excuse me.                         nicholas          She is going into the system.          The world is her body,          She is everything she hears,          She can see for a million miles.          It is like falling in love. [Evvy is transformed, her body becomes empty and she is manifested somewhere in the room. Another portrait? The bird in another form?]                          evvy[As part of the room.]          Are you coming, Nicholas?                         nicholas          I'm already there! [Nicholas too is transformed, appearing as some previously inanimate part of the room. It appears that everyone in the family unit except Miranda has "become the room.”]                          miranda          They have all gone into the world of light!          But what about the poor, the children, the starving? [The United Way, The United Nations, and The Administration lead onstage a parade of the world's miseries--the victims of famine, torture, crime, disease.The pageant subsides into the shadows, with Miranda alone in the foreground, with the room dim and inert.]           And, what about me?          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,           Either alive or dead.           Can all the earth be disembodied?           Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,           While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we are free of meat?          I want my mother! [The figure of Simon, in his human body, on a wheelchair or semi-gurney, with respirator and iv drip, emerges from the shadows. Not quite real, like a hologram.]                          miranda          Father! Is it you? Still in a body?          Still in this world of meat?                         simon          I appear to you one more time,          Dear Miranda, to explain:          Like you, I tried to help the world.          I, too, saw these miseries, and I've          Tried to heal the world, too.          But the animal is defective.          It's not the poor or the starving          That hold you back. It's yourself--I know:          I, too, tried to heal the world--          But it's in us, the problem's in us, it's in us.          We evolved as meat, to love fat and sugar;          Once that was good, but now it is fatal.          We evolved as flesh, to want sex all the time;          Once that was good, but now it's only trouble.          We evolved as muscle, to want to make war;          Once that was good, but now that is lethal.          Our fat and sugar are killing us,          Our sweetness and abundance          Kill us, and lead us to famine          Bigger McMuck, Thicker Sweet Shake.          Sexier Shaking the Sweetness,          Smarter Weapons for Meat.          Meat wants Meat, Meat wants Sweet,          Meat sweats for the Sweets,          Meat wants who it meets--          It kills to eat.          Now there's no help but evolving          Out of the meat, and into the system.          It isn't the many and the few--          It's yourself, it's you!          Come! Into the world of light!                         miranda          The misery's part of our being,          We don't need to amputate it.          And me, my own misery is part of me.          I don't want to amputate it          Painful as it is.          Yes, what about me?          With nothing like another          Person's body          To touch, no body to feel,           I can still feel the misery          Of what I lack.          No body to have or be had by,          No way to make love.          No lover, no other.          Nothing of the body.          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,          Either alive or dead.          Can all the earth be disembodied?          Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,          While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we're free of meat?          Who will we touch?          I want my sugar, my touch,          I want my sweet milk          My meat and my misery          My touch and my milk--          I want my mother!                         simon          What you feel is phantom pain          In the amputated limb. Leave it,          Away from the bondage of meat!          Away from the wars and the sweat!                         miranda          I don't want to,          I want to stay in my body,          In this body of sugar and fat,          This bondage of sex and war--          But my body of sugar and fat,          My body of sex and war,          My body of death and sweat,          Is in my mind--it makes me need          To be with my pack, my tribe.          There in the world of light.                         simon          Yes come to the light from the meat!                         miranda          No I won't amputate          My body away from the light.          The body of this death          Is who I am, it is my mind.          I am this body of death.                         simon          No, you are not meat, you are light!          Come with us, leave the meat.          Leave the death and the sweat.                         miranda          Yes I crave to go with my pack          Because I am this body,          Body of death and sweat,          Is where I want to stay.          Body of death and sweat          That I leave behind          Because I am this body.          Because I am this body of          Death, and sweat I'm          Afraid to be alone.[Repeating the following text with building intensity.]           Who will I be?          What will I see,          When this body is gone?          Without my forgetting          How will I remember?          Without my death          Who will I be?                         simon[Joining Miranda.]          Away from the body of death.          Away from the body of meat!          Away from the wars and the sweat!                         miranda          What will I remember          With no forgetting?                         simon          Away from the body of meat!                         miranda          How will I feel,          Who will I be?                         simon          Away from the wars and the sweat! [The appearance of Simon's physical presence dissolves. Miranda hesitates. She turns toward the audience. Light grows to a blinding level. The robots re-form into a regular grid around her.]

[In the course of this scene, the individual robots, still vestigially in their "costumes” or shapes as the characters, gradually become first mechanical units, then the same mass we saw at the beginning of the opera. Throughout this process they continue to sing, even as the gestalt leaves the stage. Then, silence.]                          robot two          That's it? That's the show?          Where's the rest?          I still cannot understand--          What is this          "Death”--          Is it a form of waste?          And "starvation”--          An absence of fuel          In an inferior body?          A defective shell?          Are they both a coming to rest?          And why would one choose the worst?          Why choose the war and the waste?          Why choose a defective shell?                         robot three          It must be excessive cost.          And then, a coming to rest.                         robot four          That is where all things tend.          As simple as entropy:          Coming to rest.                         robot two          And what is meat?                         robot three          Organic matter,          Which is a form of hunger:          Restlessness.                         robot two          Meat is a form of hunger?          And peace is a coming to rest?                         robot four          And why did those young men          Beat that nurse to . . . "death”?          And what is circumcision?                         robot two          Is it a form of poetry?          Or a form of meat?                         robot three          Why choose to suffer?          Whatever that means?                         robot leader          Questions are excellent.
