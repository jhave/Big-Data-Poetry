The Shortest Night
****!****

I went into the forest searching 
for fire inside pleading wood, 
but I can't say for how long 
I was moored between worlds. 
I heard a magpie's rumination, 
but I don't know if its wings 
lifted the moon or let it drift 
slow as a little straw boat 
set ablaze on a winding river. 
I learned the yellow-eyed wolf 
is a dog & a man. A small boy 
with a star pinned to his sleeve 
was hiding among thorn bushes, 
or it was how the restless dark 
wounded the pale linden tree 
outside a Warsaw apartment. 
Night crawls under each stone 
quick as a cry held in the throat. 
All I remember is my left hand 
was holding your right breast 
when I forced my eyes shut. 
Then I could hear something 
in the room, magnanimous 
but small, half outside & half 
inside, no more than a song-- 
an insomniac's one prophecy 
pressed against the curtains, 
forcing the ferns to bloom.
