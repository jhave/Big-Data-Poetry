After Stevens
It was when he said expansively There is 
no such thing as the truth that his thick thumbs 
thickened and his lips, purple as grapes, 
further purpled. When I also spun such 
spinning facilities as these, my own 
vines ripened with what I hoped might prove 

more promising fruit. Yios mou, set the large 
man's handsome books aside and sit with me 
on the airy balcony beside our kind
and loving Father Iakovos. Truth may 
prove to be no such a thing as matter 
for our mulling; still, this evening spread out

before our mountain, above our mountain tea
suggests in its late, cypress-scented air 
a pressing density, a wine-like, whelming
cup, ksinómavro--deep and dark, substantial.
And the road? Meandering, manifestly
inconclusive, and for that reason not
so likely to ferment blithe disregard.
