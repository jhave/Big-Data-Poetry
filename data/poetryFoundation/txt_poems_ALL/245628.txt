                             (there'll be days like this.)
                                                -- The Shirelles
These folks 'bout to respect me into the grave.

At eighty Mama said, (mama said)
            "People think you change when you're old
             but you still got a girl inside.” 

And men could see her, too 
         -- that pink silk dress --
soothe that hotel bellboy
         "Boy, I'm old enough 
          to be your mama.”
He coy 
          "well, you ain't.”

But seventy is prime time 
for me to own what "elder” brings.

I reap myself with the respect they sow.

They don't know I got the road 
wide open in me.
