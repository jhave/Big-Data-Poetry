Poetry, Wordsworth 
wrote, will have no 
easy time of it when 
the discriminating

powers of the mind 
are so blunted that 
all voluntary
exertion dies, and

the general
public is reduced 
to a state of near 
savage torpor, morose,

stuporous, with
no attention span 
whatsoever; nor will 
the tranquil rustling

of the lyric, drowned out 
by the heavy, dull
coagulation
of persons in cities,

where a uniformity 
of occupations breeds
cravings for sensation 
which hourly visual

communication of
instant intelligence 
gratifies like crazy, 
likely survive this age.
