The four am cries 
of my son worm 
through the double 
foam of earplugs 

and diazepam. 
The smoke alarm's 
green eye glows. 
Beneath the cries, 

the squirm and bristle 
of the night's catch 
of fiddlebacks 
on the glue-traps 

guarding our bed. 
Necrotic music. 
Scored in my head. 
And all night columns 

of ants have tramped 
through the ruins 
of my sleep, bearing 
the fipronil 

I left for them 
home to their queen. 
Patriot ants. 
Out of republics 

endlessly perishing. 
If I can hold 
out long enough, 
maybe my wife 

will go. If she 
waits long enough, 
maybe he'll go back 
down on his own.
