A Cave of Angelfish Huddle Against the Moon
****!****

Put an ear to the light at fall 
of dark and you will hear 
nothing. This pale luminescence 
that drifts in upon them 
makes a blue bole of their caves, 
a scare of their scything 
tails. They tell 
in the bubbling dark of images 
that come in upon them 
when light spreads like an oil slick 
and sea fans 
that once were their refuge 
turn away. 
Now there is no dark 
dark enough for their silver tails, 
scatter of color 
(like coins massively 
piling in the lap of a miser) 
that was, in the day, their pride. 
How hugely here we belong. 
This is their song 
in the silting 
drift of the reef. 
They have never seen the moon 
nor the black scut of night, stars 
spread like plankton 
in their beastly infinities.
