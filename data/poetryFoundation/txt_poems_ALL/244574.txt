You’ve Come Back to Me
****!****

For G
A small thing crawling toward me
across this dark lawn. Bright
eyes the only thing I'm sure I see.

You've come back to me,
haven't you, my sweet? From
long ago, and very far. Through 

crawling dark, my sweet, you've
come back to me, have you? Even 
smaller this time than the stars.
