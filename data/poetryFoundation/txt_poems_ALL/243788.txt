Dear Writers, I'm compiling the first in what I hope is a series of publications I'm calling artists among artists. The theme for issue 1 is "Faggot Dinosaur.” I hope to hear from you! Thank you and best wishes.  
 
                                                                                        --Ali, editor, Artists among Artists
 

I think that I shall never fear
a brontosaurus that is queer,

iguanodon as fetisheer,
a mammoth bringing up the rear,
an astrodon with extra gear,

metrosexual squirrel and deer, 
a breeder with a dance career,
a fruit with cauliflower ear, 

a lesbianic Chanticleer,
a grinning limpish-wristed Lear,
the weird one or the mutineer, 

but those who perfectly adhere,
stay clear, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear.
