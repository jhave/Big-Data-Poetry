Game Night
****!****

Love not   
being in the loop.   

Grant the spruces' wish,   
the golf compound   
graying out of use,   
suvs in the it lot,   
power outage,   
a chorus from the quad.   

Bless the elsewhere   
where others are   
not here or you.   

And rain   
after midnight . . .       
Ask yourself,   
is that rain or bells?
