"Was you ever bit by a dead bee?”
****!****

I was, I was--by its posthumous chomp,
by its bad dab of venom, its joy-buzzer buzz.
If you're ever shanked like the chump
that I was, by the posthumous chomp
of an expired wire, you'll bellow out prompt
at the pitiless shiv when she does what she does.
Was you? I was. By its posthumous chomp,
by its bad dab of venom, its joy-buzzer buzz.
