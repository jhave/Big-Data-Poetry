Departures: Chapter One
****!****

Morning's mirage, disdainful & calm
          as a mirror,

held the shorn bush that yesterday
          flourished,

now lopped canes & a scant spitfall
          of remnance,

confetti trampled in the clefts
          of vanishing deer.

To touch its truth I punched my fist
          into the chopped molest,

the boscage--withdrew my red sleeve.
          Abstract that.
