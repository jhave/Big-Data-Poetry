I would consider
           re-heating the tweezers
if I had the chance,
           because, as ducks say
in Ghana, "broccoli 
           reversal gets priority.”

I would consider
           re-heating the tweezers
if Tu Fu and Cleopatra
           had a son named Sel.
I have the chance, 
           because, as ducks ask,
"who was generated
           in Old Ironsides, AK?”
In Ghana, broccoli
           reversal gets priority
and grows up to be
           a pie dish dismisser.

Tu Fu and Cleopatra
           had a son named Sel
who was generated 
           in Old Ironsides, AK.
He grew up to be
           a pie dish dismisser.
