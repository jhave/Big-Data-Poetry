Why are the woods so alluring? A forest appears 
to a young girl one morning as she combs 
the dreams out of   her hair. The trees rustle 
and whisper, shimmer and hiss. The forest 
opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges, 
banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim 
kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn, 
snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden 
is driven toward the dangers of a forest, 
but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.

She's glad to lie down with trees towering all around.
A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular, 
bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair, 
tingles with kisses she won't receive for years. 
Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate 
her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her, 
or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal 
restlessness ...    our deepening need for non-being intones 
the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence. 
I'm not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,

blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic 
spangles shivering the air. Will I forget the way home?
the third blurts. Why do I feel like I'm hiding in a giant's nostril?
the oldest prone pine wants to know. Are we being   freed 
from matter? the sapling asks. Insects are well-intentioned, 
offers the third tree, by way of consolation. Will it grow
impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling, 
adding in a panicky voice, I'm becoming spongy! The girl 
feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises 
to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her.
