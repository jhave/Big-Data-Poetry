The Pull Toy
****!****

You squeezed its leash in your fist, 
It followed where you led:
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Nodding its wooden head.

Wagging a tail on a spring,
Its wheels gearing lackety-clack,
Dogging your heels the length of the house, 
Though you seldom glanced back.

It didn't mind being dragged 
When it toppled on its side 
Scraping its coat of primary colors: 
Love has no pride.

But now that you run and climb 
And leap, it has no hope
Of keeping up, so it sits, hunched 
At the end of its short rope

And dreams of a rummage sale
Where it's snapped up for a song,
And of somebody--somebody just like you-- 
Stringing it along.
