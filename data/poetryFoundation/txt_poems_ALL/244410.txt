****!****
Fado
****!****

A man reaches close
and lifts a quarter 
from inside a girl's ear,
from her hands takes a dove
she didn't know was there.
Which amazes more,
you may wonder:
the quarter's serrated murmur
against the thumb
or the dove's knuckled silence?
That he found them, 
or that she never had,
or that in Portugal,
this same half-stopped moment,
it's almost dawn, 
and a woman in a wheelchair
is singing a fado 
that puts every life in the room
on one pan of a scale, 
itself on the other, 
and the copper bowls balance.
