					Consider the rip for a mouth, the rip in the crotch, the hank of hair,consider the flair for ill-fortune, the empty stare, the done deal with sorrow, the rich and rare nest-egg of dreams, the share and sharealike in matters of loss, the payments in kind, the liking for blindbets, for truth or dare; consider the threadbare get up, the make-upbeyond repair, the tin-tack teeth, consider the dungeon voicewanting nothing more than bare house-room, and nothing less than hand-in-glove, a pigeon pair given over to make and mend, to touch and go, to wear and tear, and all it takes is this: forswear  flint and fire, stay silent, be white on white, live in dead air.
