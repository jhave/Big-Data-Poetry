Up -- or out? -- here:
a problem of preposition,

my uneasy relation

Where -- for art -- thou-
sands of windows go dark

in slow succession. On Essex
and Ludlow and Orchard.

A thousand times goodnight.

A boy throwing stones at a window.
Right window, wrong boy.

                     • 

Love goes toward love -- 

And the place death, down there

waving its white kerchief --
