Amrita  Pritam
****!****
Empty Space
****!****

There were two kingdoms only:
the first of them threw out both him and me.
The second we abandoned.

Under a bare sky
I for a long time soaked in the rain of my body,
he for a long time rotted in the rain of his.

Then like a poison he drank the fondness of the years.
He held my hand with a trembling hand.
"Come, let's have a roof over our heads awhile.
Look, further on ahead, there
between truth and falsehood, a little empty space.”
