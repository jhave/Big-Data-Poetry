Missed Time
****!****

My notebook has remained blank for months 
thanks to the light you shower 
around me. I have no use 
for my pen, which lies 
languorously without grief. 

Nothing is better than to live 
a storyless life that needs 
no writing for meaning-- 
when I am gone, let others say 
they lost a happy man, 
though no one can tell how happy I was.
