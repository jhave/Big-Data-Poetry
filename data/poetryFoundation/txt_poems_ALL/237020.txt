Teeth
****!****

For knowledge, says the Old Sage, add; for wisdom,
subtract. My head in a surgeon's chair, checking 
Lao Tsu's math as these teeth I barely knew 
I had (mumbled of as wisdom) introduced
themselves--rude party guests--right as they had
to go, their pinched goodbye-hello. Like learning
you've been speaking your whole life in prose, 
or my late eighth-grade astonishment that I--
confirmed a Gentile in almost all respects--
had hung so long among the circumcised.

Hard to know what you have, I'll have you know.
Harder to know what you haven't. Knowledge! The nerve!
Hushed up like a gulp behind the tongue,
shrewdly shooting roots down at an age 
my gums were smug from rolling words around, 
when my morals (like my molars) proved
basically interchangeable. Wise
I wasn't, but I wanted it so painfully then.
Now I've had it--you have it, doc. You know 
the drill, or whatever you've got. Take it away . . .
