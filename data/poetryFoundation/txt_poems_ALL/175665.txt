The Invisible Person
****!****

Life kept rolling her over   
like a piece of driftwood 

in the surf of an angry sea   
she was intelligent and beau- 

tiful and well-off she made   
friends easily yet she wasn't 

able to put the pieces to- 
gether into any recognizable 

shape   she wasn't sure who   
she wanted to be   so she 

ended up being no one in par- 
ticular   she made herself al- 

most invisible   she was the   
person you loved so much who 

really wasn't there at all.
