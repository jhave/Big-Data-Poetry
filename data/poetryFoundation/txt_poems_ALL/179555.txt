Wallpapering
****!****

My parents argued over wallpaper. Would stripes 
make the room look larger? He 
would measure, cut, and paste; she'd swipe 
the flaws out with her brush. Once it was properly 

hung, doubt would set in. Would the floral 
have been a better choice? Then it would grow 
until she was certain: it had to go. Divorce 
terrified me as a child. I didn't know 

what led to it, but I had my suspicions. 
The stripes came down. Up went 
the flowers. Eventually it became my definition 
of marriage: bad choices, arguments 

whose victors time refused to tell, 
but everything done together and done well.
