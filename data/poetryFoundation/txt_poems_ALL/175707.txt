The Pond at Dusk
****!****

A fly wounds the water but the wound   
soon heals. Swallows tilt and twitter   
overhead, dropping now and then toward   
the outward-radiating evidence of food. 

The green haze on the trees changes   
into leaves, and what looks like smoke   
floating over the neighbor's barn   
is only apple blossoms. 

But sometimes what looks like disaster   
is disaster: the day comes at last, 
and the men struggle with the casket   
just clearing the pews.
