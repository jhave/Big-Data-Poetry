A Word
****!****

For A.B.
She said God. He seems to be there 
when I call on Him but calling
has been difficult too. Painful. 

And as she quieted to find 
another word, I was delivered 
once more to my own long grappling 

with that very angel here -- still 
here -- at the base of the ancient 
ladder of ascent, in foul dust

languishing yet at the very
bottom rung, letting go my grip 
long before the blessing.
