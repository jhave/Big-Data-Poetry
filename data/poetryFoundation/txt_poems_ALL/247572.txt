You are smaller than I remember
And so is the house, set downhill
Afloat in a sea of scrub oak. From up here
It's an ordinary box with gravel

Spread over its lid, weighting it, but
Inside it's full of shadows and sky.
Clouds pull themselves over dry
Grass, which, if  I'm not mistaken, will erupt

Any minute in flame. Only 
A spark, a sunbeam focused. From up 
Here, enjoying the view, I can finally 
Take you in. Will you wave back? I keep

Slingshotting around. There's gravity
For you, but all I ever wanted was to fly.
