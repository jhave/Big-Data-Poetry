Corn Maze
****!****

Here is where 
You can get nowhere 
Faster than ever
As you go under
Deeper and deeper

In the fertile smother
Of another acre
Like any other
You can't peer over
And then another

And everywhere
You veer or hare
There you are
Farther and farther
Afield than before

But on you blunder
In the verdant meander
As if   the answer
To looking for cover
Were to bewilder

Your inner minotaur
And near and far were
Neither here nor there
And where you are
Is where you were
