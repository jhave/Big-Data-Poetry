from Odes: 14. Gin the Goodwife Stint
****!****

The ploughland has gone to bent   
and the pasture to heather;   
gin the goodwife stint, 
she'll keep the house together. 

Gin the goodwife stint   
and the bairns hunger   
the Duke can get his rent   
one year longer. 

The Duke can get his rent 
and we can get our ticket 
twa pund emigrant   
on a C.P.R. packet.
