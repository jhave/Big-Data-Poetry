March
****!****

Sky a shook poncho.
Roof   wrung. Mind a luna moth
Caught in a banjo. 

This weather's witty
Peek-a-boo. A study in
Insincerity. 

Blues! Blooms! The yodel
Of   the chimney in night wind.
That flat daffodil.

With absurd hauteur
New tulips dab their shadows
In water-mutter.

Boys are such oxen.
Girls! -- sepal-shudder, shadow-
Waver. Equinox.

Plums on the Quad did
Blossom all at once, taking
Down the power grid.
