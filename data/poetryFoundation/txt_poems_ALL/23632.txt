Winter mornings
driving past
I'd see these kids 
huddled like grouse
in the plowed ruts
in front of their shack 
waiting for the bus,
three small children 
bunched against the drifts 
rising behind them.

This morning
I slowed to wave 
and the smallest, 
a stick of a kid 
draped in a coat, 
grinned and raised 
his red, raw hand, 
the snowball 
packed with rock 
aimed at my face.
