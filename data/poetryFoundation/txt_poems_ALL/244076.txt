****!****

In the very night of movement where I
sought a sequential self –
The sea as blood, thought as
Earth that changes the sea
 
Changes the fishes in it
for the fortunes of landscapes
are in the fantasies
of architecture
 
H --        taught to sing
siren scales by ear
by rote or immersion
abroad
 
In the discrepancy of double exposure
Casts of light crack time's microscope
