[He Lived—Childhood Summers]
****!****

He lived--childhood summers 
    thru bare feet 
then years of money's lack 
    and heat 

beside the river--out of flood 
    came his wood, dog, 
woman, lost her, daughter-- 
    prologue 

to planting trees. He buried carp 
    beneath the rose 
where grass-still 
    the marsh rail goes. 

To bankers on high land 
    he opened his wine tank. 
He wished his only daughter 
    to work in the bank 

but he'd given her a source 
    to sustain her-- 
a weedy speech, 
    a marshy retainer.
