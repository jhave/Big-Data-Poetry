Refuge Field

You have installed a voice that can soothe you: agents 
         of the eaten flesh, every body 

         a cocoon of change-- 

Puparium. The garden 
         a birthing house, sarcophagidae-- 

And green was so dark in the night-garden, in the garden's 
         gourd of air-- 

green's epitome 
         of green's peace, the beautiful inhuman 

leg-music, crickets' 
         thrum-- 
a pulse 

         to build their houses by, 
each 
         successive molt 

a tent of skin 
         in which skin can grow, the metallic sheen 
of their blue backs 

         as they hatch out, winged and mouthed-- 

Like in a charnel ground, you sit and see. 

In one of the Eight Great 
         Cemeteries, you sit and see-- 

How the skull-grounds 
         are ringed by flame, how they spread out under 
a diamond tent, how the adepts 
         pupate 
among bones-- 

         saying I who fear dying, I who fear 
being dead-- 

         Refuge field. 

         See it now. 

That assembly of sages you would have yourself 
         build, 
to hear the lineage 
         from mouth to ear, encounter the truth- 
                      
         chain-- 

Saying, Soft eaters, someone's children, who gives them 
         refuge from want-- 

Cynomyopsis Cadavarena. On every tongue 
         they feed.
