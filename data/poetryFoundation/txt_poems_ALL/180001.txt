Operation Phantom Fury. 

*       *       * 

The full force   
of the will to live   
is fixed   
on the next   
occasion: 

someone   
coming with a tray, 

someone   
calling a number. 

*       *       * 

Each material   
fact   
is a pose, 

an answer   
waiting to be chosen. 

"Just so," it says. 

"Ask again!"
