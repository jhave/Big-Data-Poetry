"Unreal precision of the houses...”
****!****

Unreal precision of the houses at ﬁrst light
45 years of rain and bodice
Grasses woods wildﬂowers
To be the only woman at this hour
Out in it one beauty one movie
And I am her hapless mule

Out of the blue one morning
My father took me north upriver
To see the mothball ﬂeet
His war aﬂoat and ghostly
Pennants of rain hanging from each spar
It's what we are

Discards of memory
Unreal until the only woman wakes
