Coinage of the not-yet-wholly-
             hardened custodians of public 
health, as health is roughly measured 
             ﻿in the rougher parts of Dearborn.

Meaning, how many parents,
             ﻿when things get bad, are wearing
what they've slept in when they come 
             ﻿to pick up the kids at school. 

The best of talk, said someone
             ﻿once, is shop talk: we can go 
to it as to a well. But manifolds
             ﻿and steering racks are going

the way of the wells--offshore--
             ﻿so the-nifty-thing-you-do-
with-the-wrench-when-the-foreman-
             ﻿has-sped-the-line-up

has become a ghastly shorthand for
             ﻿despair among the people
you are paid to help. Despair, 
             ﻿sometimes, of helping. In

the winter dawn a decade and a half
             ﻿ago, we'd gather around
the school bus stop--the unshaved
             ﻿fathers, mothers, dogs,

the siblings in their snowsuits--so
             ﻿the children bound for
Johnson Elementary might have
             ﻿a proper sending-off.
    
The privileged of the earth, in our
             ﻿case: words and stars
and molecules were all our care,
             ﻿a makeshift village blessed

with time and purpose. And
             ﻿a school bus stop,
to make it seem like life. By far my 
             ﻿favorites were the Russian

mathematicians: bathrobes hanging
             ﻿below their parkas, cigarettes
scattering ash, their little ones for the
             ﻿moment quite forgotten, they 

would cover the walls of the shelter 
             ﻿with what 
to most of us was Greek but was 
             ﻿no doubt of urgent consequence 

for quantum fields. So filled with joy: 
             ﻿their permanent markers on the  
brick. And then 
             ﻿the bus, and then the children off 

without us and our little human pretext 
             ﻿gone. Fragile the minutes.
Fragile the line between wonder
             ﻿and woe. The poet when he

wrote about our parents in the garden
             ﻿gave them love and rest
and mindfulness. But first 
             ﻿he gave them honest work.
