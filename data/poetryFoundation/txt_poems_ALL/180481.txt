Weariness of Men
****!****

My grandmother said when she was young 
The grass was so wild and high 
You couldn't see a man on horseback. 

In the fields she made out 
Three barns, 
Dark and blown down from the weather 
Like her husbands. 

She remembers them in the dark, 
Cursing the beasts, 
And how they would leave the bed 
In the morning, 
The dead grass of their eyes 
Stacked against her.
