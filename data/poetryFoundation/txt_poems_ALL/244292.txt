But prayer was not enough, after all, for my father. 
His last two brothers died five weeks apart. 
He couldn't get to sleep, had no appetite, sat 
staring. Though he prayed,
he could find no peace until he tried 
to write about his brothers, tell a story 
for each one: Perry's long travail 
with the steamfitters' union, which he worked for; 
and Harvey--here the handwriting changes, 
he bears down--Harvey loved his children.

I discovered those few sheets of paper 
as I looked through my father's old Bible 
on the morning of his funeral. The others 
in the family had seen them long ago; 
they had all known the story, 
and they told me I had not, most probably, because 
I am a writer, 
and my father was embarrassed by his effort. Yet 
who has seen him as I can: risen

in the middle of the night, bending over 
the paper, working close 
to the heart of all greatness, he is so lost.
