Opus Posthumous

When I painted, everybody saw.
When I played piano, everybody heard. 

I ate your raspberries.
The sign no trespassing applied to me.

Now, the hemlocks have grown higher than the house.
There's moss on my stoop, a little mildew 
In the shower but you've never seen my shower. 

I can undress by the window, 
I can sleep in the barn.

The sky, which is cloudy, 
Suits the earth to which it belongs.
