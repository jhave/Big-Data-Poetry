Living Tree

It's said they planted trees by graves 
to soak up spirits of the dead
through roots into the growing wood. 
The favorite in the burial yards
I knew was common juniper.
One could do worse than pass into 
such a species. I like to think
that when I'm gone the chemicals
and yes the spirit that was me
might be searched out by subtle roots 
and raised with sap through capillaries 
into an upright, fragrant trunk,
and aromatic twigs and bark,
through needles bright as hoarfrost to 
the sunlight for a century
or more, in wood repelling rot
and standing tall with monuments
and statues there on the far hill,
erect as truth, a testimony,
in ground that's dignified by loss,
around a melancholy tree
that's pointing toward infinity.
