Strange Little Prophets
****!****

When is the smell of a blackberry tree
a harbinger of  violent movement
rather than simply the recollection of
a childhood Sunday dress hem-dipped
in mud, handprinted with juice and seeds?
Hard to say. A mind, when playing tricks
is at its most sincere -- at home raking
through the body's history, repeating
the strange and nostalgic. The taste of
dirty copper, the imagined cockroach
in the corner, the sluggish slow of  the clock
 -- doctors call these strange little prophets
warning signs of a seizure, synaptic misfires
looming like a song discordant, until the body
 -- an unplucked string -- is finally strummed.
