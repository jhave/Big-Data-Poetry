****!****
Almost As If I’ve Been Given an Horizon
****!****

The giant world
is no damned genius

with its basket of latitude,
its schedule for wanting

to be touched.
 Now, slow asleep

I'm song
to break in on,

a strength less lost
than gone.

I borrow minute, hour,
 day, day.

The waves as cruel replacements pass
 for crutches.
