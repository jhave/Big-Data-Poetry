6:48 a.m., and leaden 
    little jokes about what heroes   
   we are for getting up at this hour. 
Quiet. The surf and sandpipers running.   
 T minus ten and counting, the sun   
    mounting over Canaveral 
 a swollen coral, a color 
bright as camera lights. We're blind- 
   sided by a flash: 

      shot from the unseen 
    launching pad, and so from nowhere,   
   a flame-tipped arrow--no, an airborne   
pen on fire, its ink a plume 
 of smoke which, even while zooming   
    upward, stays as oddly solid 
 as the braided tail of a tornado, 
and lingers there as lightning would   
   if it could steal its own thunder. 

      --Which, when it rumbles in, leaves   
    under or within it a million   
   firecrackers going off, a thrill   
of distant pops and rips in delayed   
 reaction, hitting the beach in fading   
    waves as the last glint of shuttle 
 receives our hands' eye-shade salute:   
the giant point of all the fuss soon   
   smaller than a star. 

      Only now does a steady, low   
    sputter above us, a lawn mower   
   cutting a corner of the sky, 
grow audible. Look, it's a biplane!-- 
 some pilot's long-planned, funny tribute   
    to wonder's always-dated orbit   
 and the itch of afterthought. I swat 
my ankle, bitten by a sand gnat:   
   what the locals call no-see-'ums.
