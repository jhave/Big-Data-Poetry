Ode to the Steam Box
****!****

The steam box is used for bending   frames and planks in traditional boatbuilding.
With a match I became a man 
who summoned diesel

from the yellow caverns
of a ten-gallon jug, called the flame

now hissing out the hose 
at the small house of  water, that

rusted drum from which travels
an excruciating wetness -- this

is what makes the body 
otherwise, what makes it

sing. To take that 
which has decided on a shape, 

and bend, without breaking, 
the lengthening fibers. To give 

the straight thing curve. 
To make of  the tree a song 

grown long in a linseed skin,
the slick hot strake waiting 

to become parcel 
of  the round world again.
