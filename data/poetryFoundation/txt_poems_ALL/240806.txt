I was arrested because of that internal memo, 
and ended up in a cell, then I was told to sit 
with the police and the local bigwigs. 
In the hushed and fast darkening room they said 
someone--someone--had reduced the safety margin 
on the airport risk factor, and I got the blame. 
The sky that day was a pale, clear blue, but 
that was happening outside, and far away. 

The cop on duty would not open the tomb 
of the deported--sorry, departed--and as usual 
he had a story. Every movie, he said, depends 
on a script, and the narrative grows out of 
market research: a set of standard deviations. Art? 
What would they know? Open the tomb, and let me in.
