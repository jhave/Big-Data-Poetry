it's good not to drink
it's good not to piss
in the sink & it's good
not to think

the clarion ring
of   a glass clinking
with ice good to hear it
fade into a past
you can't sing

your dumb blues
is over. admit
it was always
borrowed. you paid
no dues you did
no time

but the time spent
sodden. what you thought
I think. your 
higher power's
drunk. god's
the biggest alky
in the sky

the clouds are whiskey
sours passing by
