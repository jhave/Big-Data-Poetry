Dreams
****!****

Despite the geologists' knowledge and craft, 
mocking magnets, graphs, and maps-- 
in a split second the dream 
piles before us mountains as stony 
as real life. 

And since mountains, then valleys, plains 
with perfect infrastructures. 
Without engineers, contractors, workers, 
bulldozers, diggers, or supplies-- 
raging highways, instant bridges, 
thickly populated pop-up cities. 

Without directors, megaphones, and cameramen-- 
crowds knowing exactly when to frighten us 
and when to vanish. 

Without architects deft in their craft, 
without carpenters, bricklayers, concrete pourers--
on the path a sudden house just like a toy, 
and in it vast halls that echo with our steps 
and walls constructed out of solid air. 

Not just the scale, it's also the precision--
a specific watch, an entire fly, 
on the table a cloth with cross-stitched flowers, 
a bitten apple with teeth marks. 

And we--unlike circus acrobats, 
conjurers, wizards, and hypnotists-- 
can fly unfledged, 
we light dark tunnels with our eyes, 
we wax eloquent in unknown tongues, 
talking not with just anyone, but with the dead. 

And as a bonus, despite our own freedom, 
the choices of our heart, our tastes, 
we're swept away 
by amorous yearnings for--
and the alarm clock rings. 

So what can they tell us, the writers of dream books,
the scholars of oneiric signs and omens, 
the doctors with couches for analyses-- 
if anything fits, 
it's accidental, 
and for one reason only, 
that in our dreamings, 
in their shadowings and gleamings, 
in their multiplings, inconceivablings, 
in their haphazardings and widescatterings 
at times even a clear-cut meaning 
may slip through.
