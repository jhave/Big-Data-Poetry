The Transmigration of Souls
****!****

Inside the starboard window 
of his room in a boat at sea, 
the piece of earth he's scraped from a dead gull's leg   
sprouts eighty different species, green   
under bell glass. By the sunlight   
of the oil lamp he makes rain   
as the wind picks up toward Chiloe,   
Port Famine, Concepcion, and then Galapagos. 
Here he finds shipwrecked sailors' epitaphs cut 
into the shell of an old tortoise   
who's tame enough to ride, 
too huge to slaughter. 
Here the birds are fearless. 
He can catch them with his hands, let them   
perch on his finger before he 
breaks their necks and wraps them 
in his shirt and sets their eggs on branches drifting 
from the shoreline, island to island.   
Now everywhere he meets himself. 
He's tired, and half the world from home.   
But his mind has entered the morning   
the way all the animals 
kept in his cabin in jars along the wall grow   
smaller in sequence 
until the window opens on the sea,   
so that what he'll remember 
are the wasted spaces, the desert rock spread out for miles   
as if the earth were flat again,   
dangerous at the horizon, 
where the stones, piled, shine 
against lava black. 
Dew pools in the evenings. 
A few pale leaves appear.
