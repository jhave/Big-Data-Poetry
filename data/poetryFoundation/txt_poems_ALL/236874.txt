"Some motionless conﬂict in the sky...”
****!****

Some motionless conﬂict in the sky
As of Milton's angels painted there
In all their radiance and red malice

It is a special happiness and universal
Simply to know the names of colors
And to see them said

She mixed the colors for house painters
That was Binghamton Rochester Indianapolis
I'll take less luck if it means less stink she said

A special happiness 
When clouds contest with clouds 
In ﬁxed ﬂamboyance

Good versus Evil or beautiful cold hair
God loosed angels on us and they are the air
