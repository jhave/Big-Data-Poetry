Entry in an Unknown Hand
****!****

And still nothing happens. I am not arrested.   
By some inexplicable oversight 

nobody jeers when I walk down the street. 

I have been allowed to go on living in this   
room. I am not asked to explain my presence   
anywhere. 

What posthypnotic suggestions were made; and   
are any left unexecuted? 

Why am I so distressed at the thought of taking   
certain jobs? 

They are absolutely shameless at the bank---- 
You'd think my name meant nothing to them. Non- 
chalantly they hand me the sum I've requested, 

but I know them. It's like this everywhere---- 

they think they are going to surprise me: I,   
who do nothing but wait. 

Once I answered the phone, and the caller hung up---- 
very clever. 

They think that they can scare me.   

I am always scared. 

And how much courage it requires to get up in the   
morning and dress yourself. Nobody congratulates   
you! 

At no point in the day may I fall to my knees and   
refuse to go on, it's not done. 

I go on 

dodging cars that jump the curb to crush my hip, 

accompanied by abrupt bursts of black-and-white 
laughter and applause, 

past a million unlighted windows, peered out at   
by the retired and their aged attack-dogs-- 

toward my place, 

the one at the end of the counter,   

the scalpel on the napkin.
