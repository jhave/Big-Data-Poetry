Cadenza

I watch your hands at the keyboard 
Making music, one hand with a tiny jot, 
A birthmark I think where finger bone 
Joins palm, mark of the fish, 
Living thing in search of a watering 
Hole set in a walled garden, 
Or in a field with all the fences torn: 
Where I hear your father cry into the wind 
That beats against stones in a small town 
Where you were born; its cornfields 
Skyward pointing, never sown, never 
To be reaped, flagrant, immortal.
