                 First Day On The Job


Shepherd him milk & sugar
12 o'clock among unicorns
time of blue veils
mummified Gramercy
My impressario message eaten up
ache in my crotch
I arrive at The Friends   I am sailing by way
of the sky

bus September boat with vacant windows
thank-you I am weak
O friendly tamarack
                     I'm coming with my little chair
insignificant when you manhandle God

End of my Poem

my coat a lalop girl on a dead rock
something in the air with telephones
the twin end of the day
like an atlantic squall
I can't always voice
my lyricide





                       Last Day On The Job


Forget us: alpine flowers deer
I wasn't to last for long
Forget us beards escorted by dogs
coming out of the white portals for exercise
Send her back to California with his eyes
says the kind old Good Humor Man
Send YOU to Robespière's Thermidor
where your last day of fire a mountain
of children that come up to you & say
I don't remember meeting you Goodbye
fatal hour matrons Third Avenue
And unseen indescriminant princesses who shatter
wine bottles on the lumespento traffic lights
Catshit cloud overhead while you're king
of pencil-sharpeners!


                                                                     1964
                                               From Andy Warhol's
                                        (Intransit) Monster Issue
