The Span
****!****

From the old bridge we'd been stopped on, 
a little below us, it looked like a diving board.
When the girl switched her sign from Stop to Slow
I saw across the river three men standing like old-
fashioned divers at its base, newsreels we'd seen
of men in swim caps. "Hard hats,” you literal you.

You agreed with "like a diving board,” but no spring 
to it. Something below was holding it up, something
concrete. It was the business of your life. Concrete--
but for me the men were waiting their turn over there,
each to compete for the best two-and-a-half gainer
to knife the Tye River. They'd die, you said.

"That's a fine span,” I learned, "a very long one--
they didn't make 'em like that back then.” Or us
either, I thought as I almost saw the Hard Hat bounce
at the tip, his one knee up to his waist.
"Inspectors,” you said as we drove across, "lolly-
gagging.” Whichever. Our span is ready.
