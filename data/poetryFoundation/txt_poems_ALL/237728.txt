Some dreamily smoke cigarettes, some track
****!****

Some dreamily smoke cigarettes, some track 
toddlers who walk like drunks. Buzzy,
the picnic grounds, noisy, sun-crazed, how 
forks and spoons don't exactly lie flat. 

A mountain's here, a famous overlook 
from which you'd see none of this. Like that 
first daguerreotype, its moving carriages 
and those who strolled never picked up 

in the long exposure, a Paris street emptied 
by the camera, only houses and lamp posts 
gone eternal. Or the one who stopped 
for a shoe shine, the one who knelt to the task. 

At the picnic--a commotion. A large man 
to a younger man. I don't know you! he's hugging 
and laughing. I don't know who you are, 
he shouts over and over a stillness so immense.
