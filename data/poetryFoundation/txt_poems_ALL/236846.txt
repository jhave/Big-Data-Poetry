Advent
****!****

In front of the craft shop,
a small nativity,
mother, baby, sheep
made of white
and blue balloons.

                  *

Sky
           god
                      girl.

Pick out the one
that doesn't belong.

                  *

Some thing

close to nothing
                               flat
from which,

fatherless,
everything has come.
