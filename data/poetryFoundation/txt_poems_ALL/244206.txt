The Death of Silence
****!****

A car's backfire 
rifles the ear 

with skeleton clatter, 
the crowd's walla walla

draws near, caterwaul 
evaporating in thin air. 

Silence is dead. 
(Long live silence.)

Let's observe a moment 
of it, call it what it's not: 

splatter of rain 
that can't soothe

the window's pane, 
dog barking 

up the wrong tree. 
Which tree, which air 

apparent is there to hear 
a word at its worth? 

Hammer that drums 
its water-logged warning 

against the side 
of the submarine: 

I'm buried to the hilt
like the knife, 

after it's thrown, 
continues to bow

to the apple
it's split.
