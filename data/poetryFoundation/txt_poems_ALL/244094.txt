Early Elegy: Headmistress
****!****

The word itself: prim, retired, its artifact 
her portrait above the fireplace, on her face 
the boredom she abhorred, then perfected, 
her hands held upward--their emptiness 
a revision, cigarette and brandy snifter 
painted, intolerably, out, to leave her this 
lesser gesture: What next? or shrugged Whatever.
From the waist down she was never there.
