You Can’t Build a Child
****!****

with the medicinal poppies of June
nor with Celan's bloom-fest of dredged stone, 
      not with history's choo-choo train of corpses,
    not with Nottingham's Robin Hood 
            nor Antwerp's Diamondland.

Not walking on the Strand in Manhattan Beach with her
      silicone breast implants, refinery, waves of trash,
        not out of the Library of Alexandria 
            with her burnt gardens that prefigure gnarly,
        barnacle-laden surfboards broken in half. 

You can't build the child with the stone paths 
        that we have walked on through the atmosphere,
            the pirate's plank, the diving board, the plunge,
          nor with the moon whether 
                she be zombie or vampire.
        Not with Delphi, not with fangs, or cardamom bought
                in Fez, red with spring, red with
                    marathon running cheeks.

            Not with monk chant, bomb chant, 
        war paint, not with the gigantic Zen pleasure zones, 
                nor with this harnessed pig 
        on the carousel that I am sitting on with my son 
                in Nice, France. How it burns on its axis
            as if it were turning into pineapple-colored kerosene 
        the way the Hawaiian pig, apple in snout, roasts 
            in its own tropical meat under the countdown sun.
