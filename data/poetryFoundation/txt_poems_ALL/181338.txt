Perfectly round. 
                      Perfectly black. 
No. . . not entirely black. 
He has that bluish-white at the edge of his eyes 
And his beautiful lips 
Open upon a smile of expensive pearls. 

*       *       * 

Round and dusky-headed, 
Round bellied 
Black baby, fearlessly 
Offer your unpristine hand to the daylight, 
Say hello, fearlessly, to your life.
