After Erik Satie
For an hour I forgot my fat self, 
my neurotic innards, my addiction to alignment.

For an hour I forgot my fear of rain.

For an hour I was a salamander
shimmying through the kelp in search of shore,
and under his fingers the notes slid loose
from my belly in a long jellyrope of eggs
that took root in the mud. And what

would hatch, I did not know--
a lie. A waltz. An apostle of glass.

For an hour I stood on two legs 
and ran. For an hour I panted and galloped.

For an hour I was a maple tree,
and under the summer of his fingers 
the notes seeded and winged away 

in the clutch of small, elegant helicopters.
