The Land of Nod
****!****

Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but read
and reread the part when Cain drifted east
or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, 
the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife 

of unknown origin, another race of men,
under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod 
would be a place where the blue scillas 
would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, 

the serrated sword, where the very serving cups 
were bone. As a grown man, I've heard that Nod 
never was a nation--of Cain's offspring, or anyone--
but a mistranslation of "wander,” so Cain 

could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more 
than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed 
his own brother, and therefore in any city
could have his wish, and be alone.
