“Himself let him unknown contain”
****!****

Wyatt, with no insurance on his own head, 
watching the execution of Anne Boleyn 
from his cell in the Tower, while beyond 
on Tower Hill her lovers also are executed,

reflects upon his wasted virtue and now 
redundant innocence, rueful he ever did 
let his name be known beyond the door of 
his soul or hung his star from fate thrones.
