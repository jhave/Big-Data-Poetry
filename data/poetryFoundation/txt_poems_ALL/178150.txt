The Bitterness of Children
****!****

Foreseeing typographical errors   
on their gravestones, the children   
from infancy--are bitter. 
Little clairvoyants, blond, in terror. 

Foreseeing the black and yellow   
room behind the eyelids, the children   
are bitter--from infancy. 
The blue egg of thirst: say hello. 

Foreseeing the lower lips of glaciers   
sliding toward their own lips, the children   
from infancy--are bitter. 
Them, rats, snakes: the chased and chasers. 

Foreseeing a dust-filled matchbox, the heart,   
the temples' temples closing, the children   
are bitter--from infancy. 
From the marrow in the marrow: the start.
