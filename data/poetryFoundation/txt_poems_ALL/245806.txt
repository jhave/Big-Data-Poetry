Artifice

The plastic Great Horned Owl, stuck with glue
on the stamped tin, corbelled cornice lip
impresses no one -- not the starlings that dip
and stitch, nor pigeons as they fluff and coo
around its feet. And vinyl siding's too
regular -- each molded, faux-grained strip
identical, but for dents, and that drip
of   bird shit from a sill. What if all you
might say speaks like crafted, ersatz things:
mimicry in a tongue you barely know?
Your owl signs death, the cornice stone, the fake
clapboard conjures farmhouse. While just below
the ledge, a wren's mindless gestures make
an altar of twigs, in veneration of wings.
