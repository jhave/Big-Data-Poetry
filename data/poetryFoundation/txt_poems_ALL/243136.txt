The Boom and After the Boom
****!****

The Shannon when it washes
the shoreline in the wake
of a cruiser susurruses
exactly like the Polish
language you hear in lidl
on Friday evenings, 7 pm
payday. That's what
Gerry says.

                           •

The river surface offers
space to the song:
hammer taps of Latvians
and Poles nailing planks
of a deck.        The place
between water and sky
holding sound. It is under-
loved and an amphitheater.

                           •

Latvians and Lithuanians
are nailing planks
of grooved decking.
It will be a nice feature
of that riverside property.
        Their tap-tapping
underscores the distance
between this side and that.

                           •

Winter gales have made swift work
of the billboard proclaiming
42 luxury bungalows only two
remaining.        Crumpled up
on the roadside now
two-by-four legs akimbo--
a circus-horse curtsy
or steeplechase mishap.
