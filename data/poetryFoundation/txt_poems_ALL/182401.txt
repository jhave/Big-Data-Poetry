Peter  Ciccariello

The Disremembered Glossolalist
****!****

  Peter Ciccariello provides an interesting dilemma to readers of his work. His process usually begins with the writing of a standard lineated poem, but he takes the text of that poem and wraps it around the landforms and ruins of an invented realm that he creates through meticulous computer modeling. The results are stunning and enigmatic textscapes that a reader must sift through carefully to imagine what they originally were and what they originally communicated.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>
