Gottfried  Benn
****!****
Think of the Unsatisfied Ones
****!****

When despair--
you who enjoyed great triumphs
and walked with confidence and the memory 
of many gifts of delirium and dawns
and unexpected 
turns--
when despair wants you in its grip,
and threatens you from some unfathomable depth
with destruction 
and the guttering out of your flame:

then think of the unsatisfied ones,
with their migraine-prone temples and introverted dispositions,
loyal to a few memories
that held out little hope,
who still bought flowers,
and with a smile of not much luminosity 
confided secret desires
to their small-scale heavens
that were soon to be extinguished.
