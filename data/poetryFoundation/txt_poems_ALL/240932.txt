5 am.  One-quarter past.
Distant chimes inform me this.

A bell peal knells the mist.
And sunlight's 

not yet bludgeoning. 
But some light gets blood going.  

Last night it was snowing
and now 

every path's a pall.
Though mine the only footfalls

at this hour of awe. Above 
hangs a canopy of needle leaf.  

Below, the season's 
mean deceit--

that everything stays 
white and clean. 

It doesn't, of course, 
but I wish it. My prayers

are green with this intent, 
imploring winter wrens 

to trill and begging scuttling bucks 
come back.  

There's something that I lack.
A wryneck 

bullet-beaks a branch.
His woodworm didn't have a chance.

What I miss, 
I've never had.

But I am not a ghost. 
I am a guest. 

And life is thirst, 
at best.  

So do not strike me, Heart.  
I am, too, tinder. 

I'm flammable 
as birch bark, even damp. 

Blue spruce, bee-eater--
be sweeter to me. 

Let larksong shudder 
to its January wheeze,

but gift these hands a happiness
just once.  

It is half passed. 
And I am cold. 

Another peal has tolled.
I've told the sum of my appeals.

I need not watch for fox. 
They do not congregate at dawn.

But I would, 
were I one.
