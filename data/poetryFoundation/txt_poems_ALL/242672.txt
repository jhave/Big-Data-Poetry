What do we like best
about ourselves?

Our inability
to be content.

We might see this
restlessness

as a chip
not yet cashed in.

                2

You appear 
because you're lonely

maybe. 
You would not say that.

You come to tell me
you're saving money
by cooking for yourself.

You've figured out
what units you'll need

to exchange for units
if you intend

I know I mustn't
interrupt

                3

Hectic and flexible,

flames

are ideal

new bodies for us!
