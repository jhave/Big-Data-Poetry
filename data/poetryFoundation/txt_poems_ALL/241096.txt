His Ambulations
****!****

On shanks' mare Argyle talked to himself.
Alone, he'd carry on whole colloquies
en route to some poor corpse's obsequies--
these dialogues, the way he kept his wits
about him, body and soul together,
fit for the wretched work of sin-eating.
Sometimes he counted words or parts of words
as if they amounted to something more
than sound and sense attuned between his ears,
as, for example, how coincident:
the way grace and gratis, wherefore gratitude
partook a kinship such as cousins do,
singing the same tune in different voices,
much as grave and gravitas, then gravity
kept one earthbound, grounded, humble as the mud--
the humus, so-called, God wrought humans from. 
Or how from Adam's rib was fashioned Eve--
bone of his own bone, flesh of his flesh--
whom he got gravid by implanting seed,
in her unfathomably fecund Eden.
The memory of a woman's company
would bring his ambulations to a halt
to aim his gaping face due heavenward, 
the dewy air her touch, her taste, sweet salt.
