					You and I thigh deep in Suwannee River then in a bathtub. Spanish moss clogsthe drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts. We send him away oncemore knowing he'll return to watch. We're photographers shooting on locationfor Sylvia Plath's upcoming book, Savage Beauty--wrong poet or wrong book,I know, depending on how you look at it--however, I'm the one who is whitethis time, you're darker, maybe Quechua Indian or Spanish, like actor AntonioBanderas, with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis.Years later I write a book about our affair. They bring me on one of thosedaytime talk shows, and before being reunited, we are kept in separate rooms, thetelevision split screen, green-towel man in the audience. I'm still white, so are you,both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair. Later I'm theviewer at home thinking, Like hell they'll fall for each other.
