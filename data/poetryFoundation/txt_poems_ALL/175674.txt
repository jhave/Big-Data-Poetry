****!****

Town, a town, 
But location 
Over which the sun as it comes to it;   
Which cools, houses and lamp-posts, 
    during the night, with the roads-- 
Inhabited partly by those 
Who have been born here, 
Houses built--. From a train one sees 
    him in the morning, his morning;   
Him in the afternoon, straightening-- 
People everywhere, time and the work 
    pauseless: 
One moves between reading and re-reading,   
The shape is a moment. 
From a crowd a white powdered face,   
Eyes and mouth making three-- 
Awaited--locally--a date. 

* 

Near your eyes-- 
Love at the pelvis 
Reaches the generic, gratuitous 
                   (Your eyes like snail-tracks) 

Parallel emotions, 
We slide in separate hard grooves   
Bowstrings to bent loins, 
                     Self moving 
Moon, mid-air. 

* 

Fragonard, 
Your spiral women   
By a fountain 

‘1732' 

Your picture lasts thru us 

                  its air 
Thick with succession of civilizations;   
And the women. 

* 

No interval of manner 
Your body in the sun. 
You? A solid, this that the dress 
                        insisted, 
Your face unaccented, your mouth a mouth?   
                        Practical knees: 
It is you who truly 
Excel the vegetable, 
The fitting of grasses--more bare than   
                        that. 
Pointedly bent, your elbow on a car-edge   
Incognito as summer 
Among mechanics. 

* 

‘O city ladies' 
Your coats wrapped,   
Your hips a possession 

Your shoes arched   
Your walk is sharp 

Your breasts 
         Pertain to lingerie 

The fields are road-sides,   
Rooms outlast you. 

* 

Bad times: 
The cars pass 
By the elevated posts   
And the movie sign.   
A man sells post-cards. 

* 

It brightens up into the branches   
And against the same buildings 

A morning: 
His job is as regular.
