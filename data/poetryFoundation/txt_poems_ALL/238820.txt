Summer
****!****

And it grows, the vain 
summer,
even for us with our 
bright green sins:

behold the dry guest,
the wind,
as it stirs up quarrels
among magnolia boughs

and plays its serene
tune on
the prows of all the leaves--
and then is gone,

leaving the leaves 
still there,
the tree still green, but breaking
the heart of the air.
