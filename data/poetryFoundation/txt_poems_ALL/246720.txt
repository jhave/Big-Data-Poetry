Cross the blood 
that quilts your busted lip 
with the tender tip 
of   your tongue. That lip's 
blood is brackish and white 
meat flares from the black 
swell. You crossed your mama's 
mind so call her sometimes. 
She dreams your dead daddy 
still puts his hands on her 
waist. She calls his name 
then crosses herself, calls 
the police then crosses 
her fingers. Cross me 
and get cut across your cheek, 
its fat bag full of   bad words 
and cheap liquor you hide 
from your badass kids. Make 
a wish for bad weather 
when the hoodlums get to shooting 
in a good summer's heat. 
Cross the territory between 
two gangs and feel eyes stare 
and cross in a blur of crosshairs. 
When a shot man lands 
in the garden of trash the block 
flares up like an appetite 
spurred on by the sight 
of prey, by the slurred 
prayer of a man so death-close 
he sees buzzards burrow 
their bladed beaks into 
his entry wound. Tune 
the trumpets. Make way through 
dusk's clutter. After death 
the dead cross over into song, 
their bones tuning-forked 
into vibrancy. Cross your lips, 
mutiny against all speech 
when a corpse starts singing 
despite its leaded larynx. Don't 
say miracle when butterflies 
break from a death-gaped skull, 
rout the sky, and scatter.
