And to the curious I say, Don't be naïve.

The soul, like a trinket, is a she.

I lay down in the tweed of one man that first frost night.

I did not like the wool of  him.

You have one mitochondrial speck of evidence on your cleat.

They can take you down for that.

Did I forget to mention that when you're dead

You're dead a long time.

My uncle, dying, told me this when asked, 

Why stay here for such suffering.

A chimney swift flits through the fumatorium. 

I long for one last Blue democracy, 

Which has broke my heart a while.

How many minutes have I left, the lover asked, 

To still be beautiful?

I took his blond face in my hands and kissed him blondly

                                                                                      On his mouth.
