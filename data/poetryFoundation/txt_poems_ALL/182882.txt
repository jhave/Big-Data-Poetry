Nothing worth noting 
except an Andromeda 
with quadrangular shoots-- 
            the boots 
of the people 

wet inside: they must swim 
to church thru the floods 
or be taxed--the blossoms 
            from the bosoms 
of the leaves

Fog-thick morning-- 
I see only 
where I now walk. I carry 
            my clarity 
with me. 


* 


Hear 
where her snow-grave is 
the You 
            ah you 
of mourning doves
