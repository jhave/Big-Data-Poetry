Today’s Special
****!****

Well I guess that's all locked up tight 
Says Sam who guards the mall at night. 

Sam's a puppet! He can't use his eyes.
His body is an excellent disguise. 

I'm Muffy the Mouse! I'm condemned to rhyme
Until the Christmas special end of time. 

That's Jodi, my human friend.
The world goes on and on and will not end

Hiya there Jodi. Oh hi Sam. 
Jodi straightens Jeffrey's magic tam. 

Everything's safe here let's go upstairs
Sam says through a moustache Props repairs. 

Jodi is so pretty. I hate her. 
She carries Jeffrey up the escalator

To the kid's department every night
Where he turns into space and starlight 

When I say the magic rhyme. Jeff's a mannequin 
Until the mall goes dark. Then he's a man again.
