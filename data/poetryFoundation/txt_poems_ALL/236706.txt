Ilya  Kaminsky

from Deaf Republic: 10
****!****

I kissed a woman
whose freckles 
aroused our neighbors.

Her trembling lips
meant come to bed.
Her hair falling down in the middle

of the conversation
meant come to bed.
I walked in my hospital of thoughts.

Yes, I carried her off to bed
on the chair of my
hairy arms. But parted lips

meant kiss my parted lips,
I read those lips
without understanding

soft lips meant
kiss my soft lips.
Such is a silence 

of a woman who 
speaks against silence, knowing 
silence is what 

moves us to speak.
