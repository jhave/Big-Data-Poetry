It's always darkest before the leopard's kiss.

Where there's smoke there is emphasis. 

A bird in the hand is bound for the stove.

The pen is no mightier than the soul. 

Never underestimate the nib of corruption. 

Better late than suffer the long introduction.

All work and no play is the way of  the sloth.

If  you can dream it bring the child the moth. 

He is not wise that parrots the wise.

All that glitters has been revised. 

An idle mind is a sign of  the time.

The less things change the more we doubt design.
