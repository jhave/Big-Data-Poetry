Return to Rome
****!****

Today in Rome, heading down   
Michelangelo's Spanish Steps,   
under an unchanging moon,   
I held on to the balustrade, 
grateful for his giving me a hand.   
All for love, I stumbled over the past 
as if it were my own feet. Here, in my twenties, 
I was lost in love and poetry. Along the Tiber, 
I made up Cubist Shakespearean games.   
(In writing, even in those days, 
I cannot say it was popular to have "subjects” 
any more than painters used sitters. But I did.) 
I played with an ignorant mirror for an audience: 
my self, embroiled with personae 
from Antony and Cleopatra. Delusions of grandeur! 
They were for a time my foul-weather friends-- 
as once I played with soldiers 
on the mountainous countryside of a purple blanket.
