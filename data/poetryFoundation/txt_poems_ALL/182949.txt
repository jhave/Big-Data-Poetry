Before Dawn on Bluff Road
****!****

The crow's raw hectoring cry   
scoops clean an oval divot 
of sky, its fading echo 
among the oaks and poplars swallowed 
first by a jet banking west 
then the Erie-Lackawanna 
sounding its horn as it comes through the tunnel 
through the cliffs to the river 
and around the bend of King's Cove Bluff, 
full of timber, Ford chassis, rock salt. 

You can hear it in the dark 
from beyond what was once the amusement park. 
And the wind carries along as well, 
from down by the river, 
when the tide's just so, 
the drainage just so, 
the chemical ghost of old factories, 
the rotted piers and warehouses: 
lye, pigfat, copra from Lever Bros., 
formaldehyde from the coffee plant, 
dyes, unimaginable solvents-- 
a soup of polymers, oxides, 
tailings fifty years old 
seeping through the mud, the aroma 
almost comforting by now, like food, 
wafting into my childhood room 
with its fevers and dreams. 
My old parents asleep, 
only a few yards across the hall, 
door open--lest I cry? 
                                 I remember 
almost nothing of my life.
