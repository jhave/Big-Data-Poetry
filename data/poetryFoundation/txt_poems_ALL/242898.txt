Tennessee: We are here, between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung
in a queue of escalating beads--

Carolina: It's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt

t: and a circle wherever it may be 
there was music coming on

c: which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never
springs, but waves through

t: like wired applause for antic backstage
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it 
fades

c: but only after the chorus has pulsed

t: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain
water gone dross

c: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc 
fully quiet...

t: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's
circuit opens to one

c: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings
in sudden white-rumped ascent

t: unopposed by iridescence

c: unopposed by iridescence
