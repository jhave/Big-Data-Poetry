As Is
****!****

Just north of town, a quaint Sargasso Sea 
for bric-a-brac: the barn, itself antique,
spills over with a grab-bag panoply
of outworn stock revalued as "unique.”
Typewriters tall as headstones fill the loft
where they've been ricked away like sacks of grain;
a coffer yawns the must of oak--gone soft--
when one man, squinting, lifts the lid to feign
intrigue. Nearby, his wife surveys the smalls:
art deco bangles bright as harpsichords,
a glut of iron trivets, Christmas balls,
Depression glass and warping Ouija boards.
One man's junk is another's all the same.
They don't buy much, but that's not why they came.
