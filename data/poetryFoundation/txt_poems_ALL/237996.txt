Meat-eater, salt-licker, piped spring
dribble-sucker, an exiled Bolshevik's

villa at Viareggio. The beach sheep
shit crumby money, munificent marks,

lire, dollars, Dolorous Daintyfoot,
Proudass, Chinadoll, a three-way clut-

ter, the piazza pizzeria. Mrs. Smith-
Jones, rich, gonged aground a pissoir.

At three the imprisoned poisoner's tea
tells her rice-cake fortune, it is it.

Who to who? You yew alley ewes knew
goatsuckers in Swedish horse-hide hid

the boathouse key, locked the oarlock,
sung Sam's nutsy song, Sin Fleet, at

night. Night, ketchup cup, pepper-pot,
bid bound Belinda break her bracelets:

the dirty photographs apostrophize mon-
soons. Swimming snakes shake the lake.
