The Senses Barely or The Necessities of Life

                  for Sophie Hawkes
I (Weapons)
  
 doubled corners
 of the situation
  
  
 the words duped by this dialectic
 know
 the pose of "brushing against”
  
  
 insistence
                    on detail
  
  
 severe eyelashes
  
          the weapons must
          be kept in order
  
          (take the
          game 
          of courtesy
          of charm)
  
  
 her knees crossed
 over the manner of
 his undressing her
  
  
 a chord
                    (deceptively resonant)
 a strength of image
 but scanty provisions interrupt
 her concerns for doors
  
  
  
 into sleep
 focuses
 the story can be carried in two hands
  
  
     finale:
               I have turned on
               with shifting strands
               of light
