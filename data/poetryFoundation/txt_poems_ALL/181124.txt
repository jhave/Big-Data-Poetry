The Quarrel

If there were a monument   
to silence, it would not be   
the tree whose leaves   
murmur continuously   
among themselves;   

nor would it be the pond   
whose seeming stillness   
is shattered   
by the quicksilver   
surfacing of fish.   

If there were a monument   
to silence, it would be you   
standing so upright, so unforgiving,    
your mute back deflecting   
every word I say.
