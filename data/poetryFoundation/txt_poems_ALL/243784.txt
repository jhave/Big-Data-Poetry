Little Ice Age
****!****

I have one good memory--a total 

Eclipse of the sun--when out of brilliance 

Dusk came swiftly and on the whole 

At seven years it felt good on a summer afternoon 

To be outrun by a horse from another century--

The next morning I washed up 

On land like a pod of seals 

Struck with a longing for dark at noon--

If the cessation of feeling is temporary

It resembles sleep--if permanent, it resembles

A little ice age--and the end of some 

Crewelwork by a mother who put honey

Into my hands so the bees would love me.
