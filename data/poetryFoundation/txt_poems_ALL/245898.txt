Among Women
****!****

What women wander?
 Not many. All. A few.
 Most would, now & then,
 & no wonder.
 Some, and I'm one,
 Wander sitting still.
 My small grandmother
 Bought from every peddler 
 Less for the ribbons and lace
 Than for their scent
 Of sleep where you will, 
 Walk out when you want, choose
 Your bread and your company. 

 She warned me, "Have nothing to lose.”

 She looked fragile but had
 High blood, runner's ankles,
 Could endure, endure.
 She loved her rooted garden, her
 Grand children, her once
 Wild once young man.
 Women wander
 As best they can.
