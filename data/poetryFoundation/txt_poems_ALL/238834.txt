Often I Imagine the Earth
****!****

Often I imagine the earth 
through the eyes of the atoms we're made of--
atoms, peculiar
atoms everywhere--
no me, no you, no opinions,
no beginning, no middle, no end,
soaring together like those 
ancient Chinese birds
hatched miraculously with only one wing,
helping each other fly home.
