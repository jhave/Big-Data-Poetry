10 Things I do Every Day 

                              play poker 
                              drink beer 
                              smoke pot 
                              jack off 
                   curse

go home 

          read   lunch   poems 

               hunker down 

    changes 

                  Life goes by 
                                        quite merrily 
                                                               blue

                                 Hunting For The Whale 

                   "and if the weather plays me fair 
                               I'm happy every day.” 

                     The white that dries clear 
                     the heart attack 
                     the congressional medal of honor 
                     A house in the country 

                     NOT ENOUGH
