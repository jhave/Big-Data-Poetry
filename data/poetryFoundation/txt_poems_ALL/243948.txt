Bloody hell, the world's turned 
upside down

the flame tree has become
geranium

my coral bed has grown
into a tree

the hummingbird you hammered
to the wall

though tin, could any moment
turn and flee.

The yellow sky has gone
all roundabout

and clover threes where
seaweed used to be

and blood blossoms with fire,
the powers below grow higher --
if things turn right-way-up
will the falling fire stop?

The wave is in the hill
the nest abandons me
and all the reddened earth is still 

igniting
