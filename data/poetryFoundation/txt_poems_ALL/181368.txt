To Put It Differently
****!****

Poetry chooses choice things, carefully selecting 
select words, arranging, 
fabulously, things arranged. To put it differently 
is hard, if not out of the question. 

Poetry's like a clay plate. It's broken easily 
under the weight of all those poems. In the hands 
of the poet, it sings. In those of others, not only 
doesn't it sing, it's out of the question.
