Mine
****!****

Pain trains an undisciplined mind. 
I will end yours if  you end mine. 

Little feet, little feet are playing 
Hopscotch among the landmines. 

Hope has worked miracles before. 
If  yours didn't, how can mine? 

I could have learned to welcome night, 
If only  you had been mine. 

How dare you put words in God's mouth, 
Shail?  Why not. He put ashes in mine.
