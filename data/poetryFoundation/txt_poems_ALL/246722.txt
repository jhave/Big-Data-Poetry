After "E. 1999 Eternal” by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Dear god of armed robberies and puff-puff-pass,
a chalk outline unpeels from the street, smashes 
every windshield, and leaves florid temples of crack 
on porches. Burnt-black pleats of   joint-pressed lips
prophesied your return. Please accept these nickel bags 
as offerings. Brick bastions of piss-stench thresholds 
and boarded windows require a weekly sacrifice.
Is there a Tarot card called "The Corner,” a shrike 
shown lifting a corpse from the pike of a middle finger?
Children speak to their murdered brothers with a cereal box 
and construction paper cut into a Ouija's tongue that licks 
yes when asked if   liquor could polish a skull in a way 
pleasing to the dead, licks no when asked for a name.
