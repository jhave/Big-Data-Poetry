Like Two Negative Numbers Multiplied by Rain
****!****

Lie down, you are horizontal. 
Stand up, you are not.

I wanted my fate to be human.

Like a perfume 
that does not choose the direction it travels,
that cannot be straight or crooked, kept out or kept.

Yes, No, Or
--a day, a life, slips through them,
taking off the third skin, 
taking off the fourth.

And the logic of shoes becomes at last simple,
an animal question, scuffing.

Old shoes, old roads--
the questions keep being new ones.
Like two negative numbers multiplied by rain 
into oranges and olives.
