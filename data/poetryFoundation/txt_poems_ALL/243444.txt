Not Over It
****!****

In sympathy with Gaspara Stampa
By woman so touched, so pressed,
 detachment being thought
 achievable at all
  
 is boggling in itself. Its being
 thought achievable by love--but love
 for only all (not someone's single) sentience--
  
 appears the precept of too cold
 a form of flame. How much
 of a hand in things
  
 relinquishes the hold
 of things-at-hand?
 What kiss might such
  
 a mind reclaim? A swirl of dust
 in Buddhist schools, perhaps.
 A view of several solar
  
 systems from above.
 Not love.
 The thought
  
 appeals as it appals:
 Slow learners, we must spurn
 the selving sensualities, to feel
  
 for feelers of this kind,
 unfasten passion's burner
 to identify what's under it--
  
 in short, must court
 dispassion just
 to be compassionate.
