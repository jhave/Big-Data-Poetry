Conversation with Slugs and Sarah
****!****

Up late watching slug porn, you confess
you had a boyfriend who could spin you 

like that, slug grace and slug ballet--we don't
touch the topic of slime--and those eyes 

dangling from tentacle tips must be a
kind of love or lust, sighting farther and

nearer all at once. (But are those eyes?)  
Slug sublimity suggests love's a drag, 

touch that lingers and leaves a wet trail of 
memory and... What did we do before 

YouTube? Boob tube. Boobs we have none; slugs, 
of course, don't care, can't tell girl from boy, 

(being, you know, hermaphrodites), and only 
want flesh to fly. Forget their infamous 

languor--here's litheness in loving, buoyant 
miracles of want, one slug spiraling 

on the axis of another like a globe 
slapped by an insolent hand. Neither old 

nor young, we're familiar with sluggishness, 
too tired to explain why nothing makes us 

spin like that: a-swirl, a pirouette, a gyre! 
It's either fucking or marriage, I say,

saying more than I mean. Why can't lust be
love and love be lust? you're always asking, 

even now as the slugs begin their sluggish
withdrawal--each complete in love and lust;

each mother and father to what they've made
together; each alone, content, and free.
