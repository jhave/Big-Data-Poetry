Eight Ball

It was fifty cents a game 
             beneath exhausted ceiling fans,
the smoke's old spiral. Hooded lights 
             burned distant, dull. I was tired, but you
insisted on one more, so I chalked 
             the cue--the bored blue--broke, scratched.
It was always possible 
             for you to run the table, leave me
nothing. But I recall the easy 
             shot you missed, and then the way
we both studied, circling--keeping 
             what you had left me between us.
