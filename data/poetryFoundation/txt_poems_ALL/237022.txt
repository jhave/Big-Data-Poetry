I have nothing to recant, I am just 
the decanter. You, the just destroyer, 
have in faith become the role, recalling 
for those gathered the noble fallen
with a prayer to his-grace-above-fire, 
("Turn me, I'm burnt on that side”)
St. Lawrence. Well done, I applaud. 
And you: Well executed. 

This is it. Not much else to await
when our fates touch: I've nowhere to be 
but eternity, you've nothing to catch 
but the thatch. Dry on dry,
we keep our wits about us . . .
no one to meet but our match.
