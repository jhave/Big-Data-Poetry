Little Wife
****!****

At the Oriental Institute, Chicago
They redid King Tut splendid, 
once stone-huge as this 
yet his wife's feet 
tiny, the only thing of her now
low, next to him. A few toes, some of the rest, 
a bit of ankle, that's it
in the shade of her husband's looming, massive 
looking straight ahead into the future 
where we live and can't
eye-to-eye, where to stare at him
is to suffer warbler neck, head back and up
à la the high just-leafing-out trees as bright bits
wing their blink
and hide. Little wife, 
such small feet, the thought 
dwarfs the king 
as ache, as what is 
ever left of us 
and oh, I like her better.
