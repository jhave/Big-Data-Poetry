Cuba, 1962

When the rooster jumps up on the windowsill   
and spreads his red-gold wings, 
I wake, thinking it is the sun 
and call Juanita, hearing her answer, 
but only in my mind. 
I know she is already outside, 
breaking the cane off at ground level, 
using only her big hands. 
I get the machete and walk among the cane,   
until I see her, lying face-down in the dirt. 

Juanita, dead in the morning like this.   
I raise the machete-- 
what I take from the earth, I give back-- 
and cut off her feet. 
I lift the body and carry it to the wagon,   
where I load the cane to sell in the village.   
Whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake,   
tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane;   
it is grief. 
If you eat too much of it, you want more,   
you can never get enough.
