Boardinghouse with No Visible Address

So, I thought,
as the door was unlocked 
and the landlord disappeared (no,
he actually disappeared)
and I got to examine the room 
unobserved. There
it stood
in its gray corner: 
the narrow bed, sheets
the color of old aspirin.
Maybe all this had occurred
somewhere inside me
already, or
was just about to.
Is there a choice?
Is there 
even a difference? Familiar,
familiar but not
yet remembered ...
The small narrow bed.
I had often wondered
where I would find it, and
what it would look like.
Don't you?
It was so awful
I couldn't speak. Then
maybe you ought to lie down for a minute, I heard myself
thinking. I mean
if  you are having that much trouble
functioning. And when
was the last time
with genuine sorrow
and longing to change
you got on your knees?
I could get some work done
here, I shrugged;
I had done it before.
I would work without cease.
Oh, I would stay awake
if only from horror
at the thought of waking
up here. Ma,
a voice spoke from the darkness
in the back seat where
a long thin man lay,
arms crossed
on his chest,
while they cruised slowly up and down
straining to make out the numbers
over unlighted doors,
the midnight doctor's;
in his hurt mind
he was already merging
with a black Mississippi
of mercy, the sweat pouring off him
as though he'd been doused
with a bucket of ice water
as he lay sleeping. "I saw the light,”
they kept screaming. "Do
I saw the light!”
Ma -- there ain't no light
I don't see no light.
