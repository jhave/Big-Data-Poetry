My Brother My Wound
****!****

He was calling in the bulls from the street.
They came like a dark river -- 
a blur of chest and hoof -- 
everything moving, under, splinter -- hooked
their horns through the walls. Light hummed
the holes like yellow jackets. My mouth
was a nest torn empty.

Then, he was at the table.
Then, in the pig's jaws -- 
he was not hungry. He was stop.
He was bad apple. He was choking.

So I punched my fists against his stomach.
Mars flew out
and broke open or bloomed -- 
how many small red eyes shut in that husk?

He said, Look. Look. And they did.

He said, Lift up your shirt. And I did.

He slid his fork beneath my ribs -- 
Yes, he sang. A Jesus side wound.
It wouldn't stop bleeding.
He reached inside
and turned on the lamp -- 

I never knew I was also a lamp -- until the light
fell out of me, dripped down my thigh, flew up in me,
caught in my throat like a canary.
Canaries really means dogs, he said.

He put on his shoes.
You started this with your mouth, he pointed.
Where are you going? I asked.
To ride the Ferris wheel, he answered,
and climbed inside me like a window.
