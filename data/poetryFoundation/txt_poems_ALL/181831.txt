Diarrhea: what nobody likes, 
though a word the French love to pronounce. 
They surround it with lips and tongue; 
it pleases, like saying cellar door does. 
Once I gave a pair of tweezers 
to an au pair girl who couldn't extract 
a splinter from her foot. It was a pleasure 
for both of us to see that little thing come out.
