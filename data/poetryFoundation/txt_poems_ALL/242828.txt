The World Is in Pencil

--not pen. It's got

that same silken 
dust about it, doesn't it, 

that same sense of 
having been roughed 

onto paper even  
as it was planned. 

It had to be a labor
of love. It must've

taken its author some
time, some shove. 

I'll bet it felt good
in the hand--the o

of the ocean, and
the and and the and 

of the land.
