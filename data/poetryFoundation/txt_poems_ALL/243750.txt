Midnight's merely blue,
but me, me, me, I'm 
through 
and through 
sloe, cracked soot-
on-a-boot, 
nicotine spat, licorice whip. 
You can scratch, scratch, scratch 
but I stay underskin true 
to ebony, ink, crowberry, pitch;
hoist me up by my hooves 
and shake till I'm shook, I'm still 
chock full of coke, fuliginous 
murk.
O there's swart in my soul,
coal by the bag, 
cinders and slag, 
scoriac grit, so please
come, comb 
through my fleece with hands pallid 
as snow and watch 
how they grow tarry, raven, 
stygian, ashed-- 
or, if you wish, clean me with bleach
I won't 
flinch, just char 
down to a core of caliginous 
marrow,
pure carbon, atramentous,
utterly piceous, 
shadowed, and starless,
each clumpity clump 
and eclipse of my heart raptly 
re-burnishing 
a woolgather dark.
