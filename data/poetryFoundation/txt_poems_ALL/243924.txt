These guys try to make us
match moods to products

the way once,
under love's spell,

we attached meaning
to sound,

attached sounds to objects.

The old magic won't work now,

but it's nice
to be reminded of it.

She's a tease,
tears her skirts off 

one by one.
Really?

Drops her petals
as if she could always
make more.

It's tiresome.

We know
what she looks like
naked.

On a cold night,
we can see forever.
