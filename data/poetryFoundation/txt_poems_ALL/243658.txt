Peace Be Upon You
****!****

Peace be upon you--
      ministering angels,
            angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He;
      in peace be your coming--
            angels of peace,
                  angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.

Bless me with peace--
      angels of peace,
            angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He,
      in peace be your leaving--
            angels of peace,
                  angels of heaven,
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.
