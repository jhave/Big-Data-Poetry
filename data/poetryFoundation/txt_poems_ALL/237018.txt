O, She Says
****!****

O, she says (because she loves to say O),
O to this cloud-break that ravels the night, 
O to this moon, its mouthful of sorrow,
O shallow grass and the nettle burr's bite,

O to heart's flare, its wobbly satellite, 
O step after step in stumbling tempo,
O owl in oak, O rout of black bat flight,
(O moaned in Attic and Esperanto)

O covetous tongue, O fat fandango,
O gnat tango in the hot, ochered light,
O wind whirred leaves in subtle inferno,
O flexing of sea, O stars bolted tight,

O ludicrous swoon, O blind hindsight,
O torching of bridges and blood boiled white,
O sparrow and arrow and hell below,
O, she says, because she loves to say O.
