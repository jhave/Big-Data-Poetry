Missing Persons
****!****

God and Mother 
went the same way. 

          *       *       * 

What's a person to us 
but a contortion 
of pressure ridges 
palpable 
long after she is gone? 

          *       *       * 

A thin old man in blue jeans, 
back arched, grimaces 
at the freezer compartment. 

          *       *       * 

Lying in the tub, 
I'm telling them-- 

the missing persons-- 

that a discrepancy 
is a pea 

and I am a Princess.
