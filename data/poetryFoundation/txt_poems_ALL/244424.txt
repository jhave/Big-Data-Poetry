The Plan
****!****

For Ann Forsythe Irwin Bourgois
Remembering Ann
Whose beauty began
At the crown of her head
And ran to the deep underneath
Of her feet--
Never aware of her own élan.
Now, half mad with pain, 
She crawls through her rooms,
Calling for doctors,
Falling,
Forgetting,
Consumed,
Trepanned.

Ever since the world began--
Star fall
Nightfall
Bomb fall
Downfall...
Read the scan:
Every woman and every man,
Once a flowered Palestine,
Falls blindly toward the Nakba--
Bald catastrophe,
Prescription--
According to the
Plan.
