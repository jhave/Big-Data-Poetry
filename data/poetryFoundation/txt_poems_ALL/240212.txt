Rain at Reading
****!****

We had gathered under a tent in the park
for some words before lunch and after separate mornings,
and when--twice--the poet said "capital,”
the lightning bolts that followed the noun
had me bolting too; I'd always suspected
God's communist leanings, but now I regretted
how few exchanges we know
between craft and climate:

imagine a rhyme inciting a rainbow,
blood feuds bruising the sky,
hymns of forgiveness bringing a soft
new light to the faces watching the last act,
waltzes and songs and declamations--
this would be capital entertainment!--
locked in a clinch with open air.

But the lightning was as quick as it was loud.
The clouds dispersed,
and then so did the crowd.
