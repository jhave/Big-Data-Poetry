Asters
****!****

Asters--sweltering days
old adjuration/curse,
the gods hold the balance
for an uncertain hour.

Once more the golden flocks
of heaven, the light, the trim--
what is the ancient process
hatching under its dying wings?

Once more the yearned-for,
the intoxication, the rose of you--
summer leaned in the doorway 
watching the swallows--

one more presentiment
where certainty is not hard to come by:
wing tips brush the face of the waters,
swallows sip speed and night.
