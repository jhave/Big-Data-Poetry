Sunder

A last rock-skip hurlstorm (crazing river-glass)
the closest they ever were.

In right lockstitch
snared and split some fire-supper cooked on sticks.

By dawn the older brother took to chucking
what bottle-frags he could find and crud-oysters across.
The (high-pitched) younger blacked our waters
 
 
with a yowl.

Lord the sound such as rose from him
carried so--
Carved
into us. Clings.

Hadn't they clung tooth and claw to branch and bark.
--Came a man (and truck) to take them off.
 
 
•
 
 

Dieseled those boys off
away
some say somewheres upcountry,
inland.
 
 

•
 
 

Where it was they landed (why) nobody not them knows.
 
 

•
 
 

No body not them knows
just how they humped and grubbled home
what road they'd graved what woods criss-crossed
which creeks which trains they'd hopped who helped.

Came safe home sure        but blank as houses.
Came safe home       --as him  --and him.
 
 
--as (evermore) not them.
