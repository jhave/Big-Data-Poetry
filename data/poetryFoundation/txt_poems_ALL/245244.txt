Mortal oddment, there's no wish in the blood
But beat, but stay gift-strong, but make demands
To keep within veins this ore's diffuse gold,
These voices that know without being known --
These voices that riddle thought with herself,
Ridicule thought in her flimsy eternal
Gowns a child can tear in half   with a breath --
That chorus arterial, unbribable,
Blowing song through self as a child blows
A dandelion apart --
                                      All those weeds? --
Thistle's down and thistle's thorn, dumb yellow
Globes below that bind grass to their hollow creed,
Wind's meager flute, sere song, the whole field's late
Doom? Heart-blood? Voices, you? That's my portrait? --


I kept repeating, repeating, kept re --
To repair, to repair my, or not my -- the
Mind's bower, but whose -- who mines urgency --
Or whose mind regrets all those violets rooted
In violence -- or I only mean thought, in thought,
Not violence, thinking, and the stupid leaf
Unfolding, mine, mine, mind. Here's the plot
All untended: Psyche and, and -- some thief
Unnamed -- no, some unnamed leaf, and the sun,
Yes, only the sun that through open eyes
Turns the livid leaf green. Not leaf. Meant wound --
Or is it wind, is it wind that split in half   by
A gnat, by a blade of grass, always heals its gale --
What is the wound that is being healed, healed --
