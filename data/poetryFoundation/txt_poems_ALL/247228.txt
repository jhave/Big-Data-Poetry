spring again
****!****

spring came /
the same way winter left
& summer will come
& summer will leave;        slowly
          / when no one's expecting it 
             when people are tired of waiting

like waiting for welfare checks /
          a long wait/             a slow wait

the windows are open 
but butterflies don't fly in 
to display a sense of love

           / only housefly enter 
              to sit on food       & eat crumbs

& dreams escape /
& become stolen      & lost      & used
& wasted        & thrown away
& dreamed anew

the junkies sit on the stoop 
& nod themselves into dreams
            / maybe into the ones which escaped 
& stinkball is played 
& on warm nights        the ghetto musicians play
 our ghetto song 
on garbage can tops         & bang on empty coke bottles
& sound real chévere

:tomorrow
the junkies will sit on the stoop
& nod themselves into dreams /
stickball will be played /
                                             the streets will become chalked 
                                             with 1st and 2nd & 3rd bases

hop scotch will become a game 
& tops will spin on sidewalks /

& everyone will anticipate summer.
