"walking person who has sky flowing–by one who beside is as if"
****!****

walking person who has sky flowing–by one who beside is as if 
being backward by walking in life of people? but of one being 'defense- 
less' by the huge–is elating which is time. 

    'I was by a bigger bird - inside' - walking 

    walking by (someone with the sky flowing) disturbed by being– 
by it– 
    (compared by being–to past event: man seeing red tail hawk sit- 
ting in the city beside smaller bird disturbed calling)–(one walking 
by someone)–beside is 'embarrassing as being action' in one– 
(from)(its)(in the) present. 
    'embarrassed' is being elated simply here (as:) with one.
