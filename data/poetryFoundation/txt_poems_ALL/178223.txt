Take Comfort Where You Can
****!****

Not for nothing
are we given at least as much
sense as God gave a goose,
which we have no access to, sensewise.
We don't speak goose
nor recognize what body language
there may be in a body
which is mostly neck and dollop.
But down, now there is something
to build dreams on.
We have recourse
and in the morning the feathered snow
will have come and closed the roads.
Linger. Leave off.
