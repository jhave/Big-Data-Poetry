Eros of Heroines

Sunset backlights some pine to ... a caped sponge 
and though I throw my gasp after a monarch there is no hitch, 
no hitching either to its serape or the echoing orange 
drawing a rope, horizon's doubledutch.
                               Mina Loy + Arthur Cravan 


As blood hits the air & goes red, so I burst outside exhilarated. 
He has thrown a tippet on the double-bass, which rests on its end-pin 
the way a singer rests on a glittering stiletto 
while the other foot slips on a banan--piano. The strings 
are not the electrified wires of a prison camp, but she's the instrument 
of his escape, leaving me to educate my feelings, 
subtracting the red from night til a winebottle dawns green.
                              Leonora Carrington + Max Ernst 


I saw the chessplayers over their griddles, all the furor of thinking
swallowed like a song in a furred flute; so it must seem 
when a small daughter disappears with a wife, 
morning reabsorbed into a lambent priori.
                              Jacqueline Lamba + Andr Breton
