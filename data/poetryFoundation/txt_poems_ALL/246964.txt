I Want to be Stark[like]

Game of Thrones
A man is only worth what people say he is
and those Starks are good stock. They'll knee-deep it.
They famish the craving they are fathered by.
Manning the forestry of life, they are steadfast and sturdy.

When pungent or cruel, they sauce the ache.
Light folds them in two. 
What I want to say is, I would meet you upon this.

Let me, too, carry the token of the world. 
Tell me the secret of what comes next,
and then take me
