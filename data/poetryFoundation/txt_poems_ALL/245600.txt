A Fable
****!****

Purveyor of  rot and whatnot, 
entrepreneur of  I forgot, 
with wrists hard as hammers -- 
that birthmark a slot -- 

grip it, strip it, flip it hard -- 
ramp my shard.
If  fear be sexy, a synch 
& a match -- 

Gone the way of  wax & worms -- 
gone like November 2011 -- 
sweet by nature, mean by culture -- 

"Goodbye, luck, you idiot,” 
said the Fox to the Grapes. 
"I love you,” replied the Grapes.
