A storm and so a gift. 
       Its swift approach 
             lifts gravel from the road. 
A fence is flattened in 
       the course of   the storm's 
             worse attempt at language -- 
thunder's umbrage. A tree 
       is torn apart, 
             blown upward through a bedroom 
window. A boy winnows 
       through the pile 
             of shards for the sharpest parts
from the blown-apart 
       glass. He has 
             a bag that holds found edges 
jagged as a stag's
       horns or smooth as 
             a single pane smashed into 
smaller panes that he sticks 
       his hand into 
             to make blood web across 
his ache-less skin flexing 
       like fish gills 
             O-lipped for a scream
it cannot make.
       He wants to feel 
             what his friends have felt, 
the slant of fear on their faces 
       he could never 
             recreate, his body configured 
without pain. When his skin's 
       pouting welts 
             don't rake a whimper 
from his mouth, he runs 
       outside, arms up 
             for the storm, aluminum 
baseball bat held out 
       to the sky 
            until lightning with an electric 
tongue makes his viscera 
       luminescent; 
             the boy's first word for pain
       is the light's 
             new word for home.
