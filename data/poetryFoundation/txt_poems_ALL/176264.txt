Montale’s Grave
****!****

Now that the ticket to eternity 
has your name on it, we are here to pay   
the awkward tribute post-modernity 
allows to those who think they think your way 

but hear you only faintly, filtered through   
a gauze of echoes, sounding in a voice 
that could be counterfeit; and yet the noise   
seems to expand our notion of the true. 

An ivory forehead, landscape drunk on light,   
mother-of-pearl that flashes in the night:   
intimations of the miracle 
when the null steps forward as the all-- 

these were signals, sparks that spattered from   
the anvil of illusions where you learned   
the music of a generation burned 
by an old myth: the end that will not come. 

There is no other myth. This sun-drenched yard   
proves it, freighted with the waiting dead,   
where votive plastic hyacinths relay 
the promise of one more technicolor day 

--the promise that is vouchsafed to you, scribe,   
and your dictator, while your names get blurred   
with all the others, like your hardest word   
dissolving in the language of the tribe.
