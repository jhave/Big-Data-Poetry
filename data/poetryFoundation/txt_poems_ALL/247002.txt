                                        . . . I drank
and was surprised 
to see what looked like tea leaves 
at the bottom 
of the cup . . . minutes
later a great warm green wave 
or cloud 
began advancing towards me. "Look at the boats 
on his shirt,” I felt myself trying
to say, in Spanish, or Moroccan, yet knowing 
I knew
none of the words . . .  

                                          it was bright 
morning, and the train had arrived
and emptied 
at Chamartín before I finally 
pried open my eyes, and saw
on the carriage floor
nothing but an unfamiliar 
pair of trainers: cracked
white leather, with three green stripes. "Mister -- 
or rather Herr -- Adolf 
Dassler made these,” I thought. But which
of the two friendly men with whom 
I'd shared the carriage, and some wine,
had been wearing them? I pondered
this awhile, then fell
asleep again . . .

                              and did 
Herr Dassler visit, personally, all the cities inscribed
on his trainers? Koln, Dublin, Paris, Montreal, 
Kopenhagen, Bern, Amsterdam . . . and fit 
the trainer to the city? Rom, like these, Vienna, 
London . . .    

                    Señor Dassler, I am dreaming of you
on a bench on a platform in a train station 
in Madrid, unable
to wake up, a pair 
of your trainers, that weren't mine, but now are,
on my feet . . .    

                            I am swimming, Herr 
Dassler, in your wake, though I fear
you are dead, a corpse washed clean by the numbing tides 
with three slanting stripes emblazoned 
on your chest, your passport and your wallet 
drifting to the ocean floor . . .    

                                                       I discovered
in a pocket -- oh! the kindness 
of strangers! -- about 
forty pesetas; but casting 
around for a joke or silver lining, I found 
nada -- or niente, as I put it
to my shoes . . . closing 
my eyes, I imagined fingers untying 
and easing off my Reeboks, as the train 
hurtled through the darkness, the men trying 
them on in turn, the ex-owner of these 
flexing his toes, padding up and down, nodding 
approval. They must have whispered 
like parents, as they lifted my shirt and unfastened
my money belt, or perhaps, more like surgeons, they used
scissors, or a knife . . .    

                                          snicker-snack! I watched
the vorpal blade trace
arabesques across my breastbone, hover, then slide
between two ribs. Chug-chug
went the trains. The heat 
was building, the potion
at last wearing off. How light 
I'd be, I now 
began to reason, as quick and canny 
as a lizard, a perfectly camouflaged 
lizard, who'd shed a skin and acquired a new 
way of walking.
