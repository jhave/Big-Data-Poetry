Crow school 
is basic and 
short as a rule-- 
just the rudiments 
of quid pro crow 
for most students. 
Then each lives out 
his unenlightened 
span, adding his 
bit of blight 
to the collected 
history of pushing out 
the sweeter species; 
briefly swaggering the 
swagger of his 
aggravating ancestors 
down my street. 
And every time 
I like him 
when we meet.
