Yet I am. I exists. I has
a body,
When I see

my wife's slender boyish legs 
the roof 
of my mouth goes dry.

She takes my toe
in her mouth.
Bites lightly.

How do we live on earth, Mosquito?
If I could hear 

you what would you say?
Your answer, Mosquito!

Above all, beware
of sadness

on earth we can do
--can't we?--

what we want.
