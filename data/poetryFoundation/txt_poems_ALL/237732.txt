Glass of Water Encounter
****!****

She dances only in her necklace,
scotch-lit surely. He touches his glasses.

Nightie-less, dugs whipping, hair sprung,
some music inside, out, wet tongue

tip at her lip, no mere palsied shuffle,
both bony feet lifted, elbows awful.

Shakespeare's banshee of wailing parts,
a woman with hair, a woman with warts.

He's fixed to the floor. Dear Heloise:
do other presumed-sane mothers do this--

wait in the dark after the ball
to strip for their sons at the end of the hall?

A dream, insists his sister
but his first wife knows better.
