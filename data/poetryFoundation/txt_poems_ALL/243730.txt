"Even when you are not in a room, you are in it, your voice everywhere.” –Bill Holm
        "Even when you are not in a room, 
        you are in it, your voice everywhere.”  –Bill Holm

The message that's recorded on the phone
is unmistakably bad news, and then
another call tells us it's one we love--
a sudden death while traveling, somehow
appropriate for one who always
seized life too completely to stand still.

A door slams shut, a wall has dropped away, 
and once again I'm driven back to
empty pages, insufficient words,
to rooms he always filled on entering--
rooms lined with books, piano music, and
good friends who raise their glasses one last time.

And now, as all the lights are blinking off
in every prairie town we've ever loved,
when all the toasts are made and songs are sung,
when leaving is the only certainty,
a single voice keeps echoing, along
each dark, untraveled hallway of the heart.
