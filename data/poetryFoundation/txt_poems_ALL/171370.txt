Sunlight fades 
the storefront full of magazines. 
Month to month 
they boss us--the covers, 
they tell us 
that if we want to get happy & alluring   
(real happy, alluring sexually) 
we must for goddamn sure 
take up the breeding of Jack Russell terriers,   
or else dig 
ourselves 
a little backyard fishpond. 

Days of fish, days of dog, days of sex-- 
in that order, necessarily. 

In the sun 
all the titles are trying 
to vanish--phrases like trout pond 
diluted, the 20-point sans serif, inked-red   
passion bleached now, apathetic, ghostly-- 
words that want my attention   
like movers on the street lugging mirrors, 
a moment when I seem to   
come toward myself & then   
I'm gone 
too. I am not 
a greedy man. All I want 
is to be a visitor to this life.
