wishes for sons
****!****

i wish them cramps.

i wish them a strange town

and the last tampon.

i wish them no 7-11.


i wish them one week early

and wearing a white skirt.

i wish them one week late.


later i wish them hot flashes

and clots like you 

wouldn't believe.    let the 

flashes come when they

meet someone special.

let the clots come

when they want to.


let them think they have accepted

arrogance in the universe,

then bring them to gynecologists

not unlike themselves.
