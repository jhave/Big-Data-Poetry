P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blanketts, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race.                                      -- General Jeffery Amherst in a letter dated  July 16, 1763
Over the warming ground, swings toll like clock tower bells.
Squirrels spiral the trunk of a pine.
We fill a pail with sand. 
The day is robin's eggshell fine.

My mother's shoulder had three shallow scars.
Shining archipelago.
The quiet theaters of our lives. 
Immune is a sung word, skirting sorrow.

Kneeling at no registry of toddlers with amorphous voices.
Night sweats without monument.
The lake has the sea on its breath.
One man has an island.
