Piano

Her wattled fingers can't
stroke the keys with much
grace or assurance anymore,
and the tempo is always
rubato, halting, but still
that sound--notes quivering
and clear in their singularity,
filing down the hallway--
aches with pure intention, the
melody somehow prettier
as a remnant than
whatever it used to be.
