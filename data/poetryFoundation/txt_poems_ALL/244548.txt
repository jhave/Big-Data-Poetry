among the graves
  
 marked guest
  
  
             of houses         of wanderers
scattered in light
  
  
 this afternoon is the same time
 every afternoon
  
  
 to pass through again
  
 myself tomorrow
  
 will seem
  
             the same as yesterday's
  
 perfect hour
  
  
 to pass
  
 to name
 but everyone's
  
 houses
  
 shuddering
  
 under flags
  
  
                                        remain between
                                        gestures
  
 all things
 in form
 in faces
