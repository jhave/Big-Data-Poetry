Draw Near

For near is where you'll meet what you have wandered 
far to find. And near is where you'll very likely see 
how far the near obtains. In the dark katholikon
the lighted candles lent their gold to give the eye
a more than common sense of what lay flickering
just beyond the ken, and lent the mind a likely
swoon just shy of apprehension. It was then
that time's neat artifice fell in and made for us
a figure for when time would slip free altogether.
I have no sense of what this means to you, so little
sense of what to make of it myself, save one lit glimpse 
of how we live and move, a more expansive sense in Whom.
