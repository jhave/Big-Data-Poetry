New Orleans, Louisiana
For the drowning, yes, there is always panic.
Or peace. Your body behaving finally by instinct
alone. Crossing out wonder. Crossing out
a need to know. You only feel you need to live.
That you deserve it. Even here. Even as your chest
fills with a strange new air, you will not ask 
what this means. Like prey caught in the wolf's teeth,
but you are not the lamb. You are what's in the lamb 
that keeps it kicking. Let it.
