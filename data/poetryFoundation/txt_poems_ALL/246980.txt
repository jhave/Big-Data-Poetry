The Duck Shit at Clarion Creek
****!****

We liked to stick it in a bb gun and shoot it. 
We tattooed with it. We said hallelujah, 
the poor man's tanning lotion. 
Then the frack wells began, something black 
capping the water and we got high 
watching a green-backed heron die. 
We got funny at Clarion, flung 
each other's underwear into the trees. 
Why was it we got naked there 
and nowhere else? Maybe we knew 
we were getting good and ugly, rusted inside 
as the trucks we rode into the water. 
Maybe we knew we only appeared 
to be floating, but soon and wholly 
we'd go under, and there 
would be nothing of return.
