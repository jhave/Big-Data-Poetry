Achilles Holt, Stanford, 1930
Here for a few short years 
Strengthen affections; meet, 
Later, the dull arrears
Of age, and be discreet.

The angry blood burns low. 
Some friend of lesser mind 
Discerns you not; but so 
Your solitude's defined.

Write little; do it well.
Your knowledge will be such, 
At last, as to dispel
What moves you overmuch.
