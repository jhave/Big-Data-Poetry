Prologue to a Bidding
****!****

Though each single life occurs 
in a series of occasions   
         striking only by what 
blurry context 
         precedes them 
               So come to know 
               what I should have wanted 
               to say--from   
an internal perspective   
there is no series. Only 
         event. Music knocks 
us down. His brow 
               shadowing the guitar player's 
         accipitrine eyes. Tile roofs   
glistening under rain.   
On a dirt road 
a resuscitative walk.   
               The kite hits 
         the copperhead. Cicadas 
halt. The air blanks. 
         And strangers crane up 
         from whatever they are doing 
to meet your gaze as you go past,   
         thinking, I am with you, I am   
                                    you.
