Sympathy
****!****

Whose table is that, left on three legs?
If there's been a mistake, it may be 
in assuming less vulnerability 
as one fills the vase--

whose buoyant comfort exaggerates 
at the sight of his own proffered, 
sympathetic hand, striking him so clean
in comparison

gloved white, magician--for a sec 
he even sees the calla lily's furl
in the gesture of voilà!
